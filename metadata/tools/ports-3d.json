The functions are fast, and have been verified against the publications from which they are derived. Arbitrary ROIs can be used for texture metric computation, simply supply a 3D binary mask. Texture metrics include Histogram-based metrics, Gray Level Co-Occurance Matrix (Haralick), Neighborhood Graytone Difference Matrix, and Size Zone Matrix calculations.","addition_date":"2021-05-05T10:55:51Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-20T19:14:13Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.1.0.0"],"collections":["File Exchange","MATLAB"]}}}
