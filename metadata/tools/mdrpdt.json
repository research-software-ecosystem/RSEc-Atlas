It allows identification of single-locus effects or joint effects of multiple loci in families of diverse structure. We present simulations to demonstrate the validity of the test and evaluate its power.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:50:49Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:45Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
