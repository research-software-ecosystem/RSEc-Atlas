ProSAP provides an integrated analysis workflow for thermal shift assay, which includes five modules: data preprocessing, data visualization, TPP analysis, NPARC analysis and iTSA analysis. With the assistance of the user-friendly interface, researchers can easily compare several statistical strategies, analyze the results and draw the conclusion from the proteomics quantitative table obtained by Proteome Discoverer or MaxQuant. Users would also benefit from a comprehensive overview of the performance of different algorithms, and apply appropriate algorithms to their dataset easily.","addition_date":"2022-07-05T09:21:36.076185Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:57:29.749905Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ProSAP","home":"https://bio.tools/prosap","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"ProSAP (Protein Stability Analysis Pod) is standalone and user-friendly software with graphical user interface (GUI).
