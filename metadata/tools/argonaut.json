Spreadsheets of quantitative values can be uploaded and organized in a way that best describes your specific experimental setup. Brief statistical analysis is conducted on uploaded data to calculate the significance of molecular perturbations for each condition. These data can then be queried on-the-fly to conduct commonly conducted analyses inside the data portal, including volcano plots, GO enrichment, linear correlations, and others.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:01:00Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-28T18:46:45Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Argonaut","home":"https://bio.tools/argonaut","summary":"Argonaut is a web-based utility which facilitates collaborative exploration of Condition/Control-type mass spectrometry experiments.
