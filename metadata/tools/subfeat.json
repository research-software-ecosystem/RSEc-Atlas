It is an extension edition of the PyFeat. We additionally provide the feature overlapping option that user can customize it for own research purposes; we also prove an ensemble classification technique. This After that, it can train model, to evaluate model using various machine learning techniques.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:18:41Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-24T10:54:37Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SubFeat","home":"https://bio.tools/subfeat","summary":"SubFeat: Feature Subspacing Ensemble Classifier for Function Prediction of DNA, RNA and Protein/Peptide Sequences.\n\nThe SubFeat is an extensive Python-based tool for generating various numerical feature representation schemes from DNA, RNA and protein primary structure sequences.
