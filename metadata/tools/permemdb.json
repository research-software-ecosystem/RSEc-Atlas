In an effort to collect data regarding this heterogeneous group of proteins we designed and constructed a database, called PerMemDB. PerMemDB is currently the most complete and comprehensive repository of data for eukaryotic peripheral membrane proteins deposited in UniProt or predicted with the use of MBPpred - a computational method that specializes in the detection of proteins that interact non-covalently with membrane lipids, via membrane binding domains. The first version of the database contains 231,770 peripheral membrane proteins from 1009 organisms.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:46:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-07T19:13:45Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PerMemDB","home":"https://bio.tools/PerMemDB","summary":"A database for eukaryotic peripheral membrane proteins.\n\nThe majority of all proteins in cells interact with membranes either permanently or temporarily.
