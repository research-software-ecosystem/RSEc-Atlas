It makes use of published models and/or KEGG, MetaCyc databases, coupled with extensive gap-filling and quality control features. The software suite also contains methods for visualizing simulation results and omics data, as well as a range of methods for performing simulations and analyzing the results. The software is a useful tool for system-wide data analysis in a metabolic context and for streamlined reconstruction of metabolic networks based on protein homology.","addition_date":"2018-07-18T09:31:39Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:23:23.622737Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Script"],"version":["2.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RAVEN Toolbox","home":"https://bio.tools/raven_toolbox","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"2.0","summary":"The RAVEN (Reconstruction, Analysis and Visualization of Metabolic Networks) Toolbox 2 is a software suite for Matlab that allows for semi-automated reconstruction of genome-scale models (GEMs).
