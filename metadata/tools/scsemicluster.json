Here, we propose a flexible single cell semi-supervised clustering and annotation framework, scSemiCluster. Notably, without explicit feature alignment and batch effect correction, scSemiCluster outperforms other state-of-the-art, single-cell supervised classification and semi-supervised clustering annotation algorithms in both simulation and real data. In addition, scSemiCluster is suitable for cell annotation on single data and cross-data.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:29:37Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-13T16:34:59Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"scSemiCluster","home":"https://bio.tools/scsemicluster","summary":"Single-cell RNA-seq data semi-supervised clustering and annotation via structural regularized domain adaptation.\n\nThe identification of cell types plays an essential role in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, which, in turn, influences the discovery of regulatory genes that induce heterogeneity.
