The main function is flexdog(), which allows the specification of many different genotype distributions. An experimental function that takes into account varying levels of relatedness is implemented in mupdog(). Also provided are functions to simulate genotypes, rgeno(), and read-counts, rflexdog(), as well as functions to calculate oracle genotyping error rates, oracle_mis(), and correlation with the true genotypes, oracle_cor(). These latter two functions are useful for read depth calculations. Run browseVignettes(package = \"updog\") in R for example usage. See Gerard et al.
