Additionally, a functional analysis module puts biological meaning behind the list of DE miRNAs and eases the process of biomarker identification.","addition_date":"2023-05-31T07:46:01.760391Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:47:26.848503Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Workflow"],"version":["1.1.0"],"collections":["MBS"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"myBrain-Seq","home":"https://bio.tools/mybrain-seq","license":"MIT","version":"1.1.0","summary":"MyBrain-Seq is a Compi pipeline for performing full analyses of miRNA-Seq data, with particular interest on neuropsychiatric data.
