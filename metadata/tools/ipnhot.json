It needs one input file: pdbfile which contains the coordinates of a protein-nucleic acid complex. More details can be found in the tutorial.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:41:48Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T09:45:02Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iPNHOT","home":"https://bio.tools/ipnhot","summary":"A knowledge-based approach for identifying protein-nucleic acid interaction hot spots.\n\nA webserver for identifying protein-nucleic acid interfaces hotspot residues. iPNHOT was developed by using support vector machine based on three different kinds of features including atom number of the residue, depth and protrusion index, solvent accessible surface area, electrostatic potential and secondary structure.
