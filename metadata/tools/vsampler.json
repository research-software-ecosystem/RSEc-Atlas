Given input variants, vSampler could randomly sample control variants with matched minor allele frequency (MAF), distance to closet transcription start site (DTCT), number of nearby genes, number of variants in LD, GC content and many other properties. These matched random controls could be used to construct null distribution for GWAS enrichment analysis to estimate significance of enrichment empirically or serve as negative training/test data for regulatory variant prediction methods.\n\nvSampler runs significantly faster than existing tools, supports both SNPs and indels and provides comprehensive state of art variant annotations as matching properties. A novel data structure and algorithm were developed to achieve this performance improvement.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:21:24Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-13T15:50:46Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"vSampler","home":"https://bio.tools/vsampler","summary":"vSampler is both a web-based tool and a local program to support matched control variant sampling.
