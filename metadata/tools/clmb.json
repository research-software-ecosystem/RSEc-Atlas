The basic idea of the CLMB module is that, since the noise of real dataset is hard to calculate, we add simulated noise to the data and force the training to be robustto them. By effectively tacking the noise in the metagenomics data using the contrastive deep learning framework, it is possible to group pairs of contigs that originate from the same type of bacterial together while dividing contigs from different species to different bins.","addition_date":"2022-03-28T13:31:50.993992Z","last_update_date":"2022-03-28T13:31:50.996369Z","tool_type":["Workbench"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CLMB","home":"https://bio.tools/clmb","license":"MIT","summary":"Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB) is a framework for metagenomic binning.
