{"tool_name":"white_rabbit","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"white_rabbit","home":"http://ohdsi.github.io/WhiteRabbit/","license":"Apache-2.0","summary":"WhiteRabbit is a software tool to help prepare for ETLs (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) of longitudinal healthcare databases into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The source data can be in comma-separated text files, or in a database (MySQL, SQL Server, ORACLE, PostgreSQL); the CDM will be in a database (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL).\n\nThe main function of WhiteRabbit is to perform a scan of the source data, providing detailed information on the tables, fields, and values that appear in a field. This scan will generate a report that can be used as a reference when designing the ETL, for instance when using the Rabbit-In-a-Hat tool. Rabbit-In-a-Hat uses the scan document and displays source data information through a graphical user interface to allow a user to connect source data structure to the CDM data structure. The function of Rabbit-In-a-Hat is to generate documentation for the ETL process, not generate code to create an ETL.","addition_date":"2023-01-25T11:01:19.528168Z","last_update_date":"2023-02-01T12:05:20.887615Z","version":["v0.10.7"],"collections":["IMPaCT-Data"]}}}
