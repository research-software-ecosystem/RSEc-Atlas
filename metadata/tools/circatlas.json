Existing circular RNA (circRNA) databases have become essential for transcriptomics. However, most are unsuitable for mining in-depth information for candidate circRNA prioritization. To address this, we integrate circular transcript collections to develop the circAtlas database based on 1070 RNA-seq samples collected from 19 normal tissues across six vertebrate species. This database contains 1,007,087 highly reliable circRNAs, of which over 81.3% have been assembled into full-length sequences. We profile their expression pattern, conservation, and functional annotation. We describe a novel multiple conservation score, co-expression, and regulatory networks for circRNA annotation and prioritization.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:36:52Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T18:43:17Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"circAtlas","home":"https://bio.tools/circatlas","summary":"circAtlas is an integrated resource of one million highly accurate circular RNAs from 1070 vertebrate transcriptomes.
