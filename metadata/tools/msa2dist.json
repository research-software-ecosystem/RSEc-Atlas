It uses scoring matrices to be used in these pairwise distance calcualtions which can be adapted to any scoring for DNA or AA characters. E.g. by using literal distances MSA2dist calcualtes pairwise IUPAC distances.","addition_date":"2022-10-05T15:26:56.069772Z","last_update_date":"2022-11-05T08:17:42.926514Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.0.0","1.2.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
