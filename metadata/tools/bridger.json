It uses RNA-Seq reads as input in fasta or fastq format, outputs all transcripts in fasta format, without using a reference genome. It works in two steps: First, Bridger partitions the sequence data into many individual splicing graphs, each capturing the full transcriptional complexity at a given gene or no more than a few genes. Then, it uses a rigorous mathematical model called minimum path cover to search an optimal set of paths.","addition_date":"2017-08-20T15:17:35Z","last_update_date":"2019-09-04T08:37:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["Animal and Crop Genomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Bridger","home":"https://bio.tools/bridger","license":"BSL-1.0","summary":"De novo transcriptome assembler for RNA-Seq data.
