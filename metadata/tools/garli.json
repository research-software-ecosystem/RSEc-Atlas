Using an approach similar to a classical genetic algorithm, it rapidly searches the space of evolutionary trees and model parameters to find the solution maximizing the likelihood score. It implements nucleotide, amino acid and codon-based models of sequence evolution, and runs on all platforms.","addition_date":"2021-05-26T19:58:33Z","last_update_date":"2021-06-25T09:46:04Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"]}}}
