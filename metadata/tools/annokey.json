Its purpose is to help users prioritise genes by relevance to a domain of interest, such as \u201cbreast cancer\u201d or \u201cDNA repair\u201d etcetera. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords and terms that are likely to be highly correlated with their domain of interest.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:36Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
