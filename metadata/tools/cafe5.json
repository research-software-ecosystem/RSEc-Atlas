The program uses a birth and death process to model gene gain and loss across a user-specified phylogenetic tree. The distribution of family sizes generated under this model can provide a basis for assessing the significance of the observed family size differences among taxa.","addition_date":"2022-03-16T09:41:59.016111Z","last_update_date":"2022-03-16T09:41:59.018727Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"cafe5","home":"https://bio.tools/cafe5","license":"ECL-2.0","summary":"The purpose of CAFE is to analyze changes in gene family size in a way that accounts for phylogenetic history and provides a statistical foundation for evolutionary inferences.
