IsoTV incorporates various tools to predict protein domains, secondary structure, disordered regions, and post-translational modification sites. The visualization facilitates comparison of the set of transcript isoforms expressed across conditions and explored the functional consequences of isoform differences. IsoTV supports a range of transcriptome sequencing technologies, including short-reads, Oxford Nanopore (ONT) long-reads, Pacific Bio-sciences (PacBio) long-reads. It also supports other inputs, including single or multiple gene sequences.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:58:32Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:37:44.396491Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IsoTV","home":"https://bio.tools/isotv","summary":"Processing and visualizing functional features of translated transcript isoforms.\n\n\nIsoTV is Snakemake pipeline to analyze and visualize functional features of translated transcript isoforms.
