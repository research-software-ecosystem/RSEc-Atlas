IReNA performs modular regulatory network to reveal key transcription factors and significant regulatory relationships among modules, providing biological insights on regulatory mechanisms.","addition_date":"2022-04-29T10:43:49.714511Z","last_update_date":"2022-04-29T10:43:49.717501Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IReNA","home":"https://bio.tools/irena","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"IReNA (Integrated Regulatory Network Analysis) is an R package to perform regulatory network analysis.
