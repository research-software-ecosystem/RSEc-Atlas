However, it remains cumbersome to assess each and every amino acid of a given protein in relevance to its functional significance. Here, we report a strategy, PArsing fragmented DNA Sequences from CRISPR Tiling MUtagenesis Screening (PASTMUS), which provides a streamlined workflow and a bioinformatics pipeline to identify critical amino acids of proteins in their native biological contexts. Using this approach, we map six proteins-three bacterial toxin receptors and three cancer drug targets, and acquire their corresponding functional maps at amino acid resolution","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:46:50Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-05T09:28:42Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PASTMUS","home":"https://bio.tools/PASTMUS","summary":"Mapping functional elements at single amino acid resolution in human cells.\n\nIdentification of functional elements for a protein of interest is important for achieving a mechanistic understanding.
