G4Killer is based on the G4Hunter algorithm. This tool is a platform-independent and user-friendly application to design mutations crippling G4 propensity in a parsimonious way (i.e., keeping the primary sequence as close as possible to the original one). The tool is integrated into our DNA analyzer server and allows for generating mutated DNA sequences having the desired lowered G4Hunter score with minimal mutation steps.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:11:29Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-11T13:25:41Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"G4Killer","home":"https://bio.tools/g4killer","summary":"G4Killer is a web application to design G-quadruplex mutations.
