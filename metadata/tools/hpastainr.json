The purpose of this tool is to test if a list of proteins/genes is associated with a certain cell type in a HPA tested tissue. E.g. you have a list of protein coding genes from a differential expression single cell analysis and want to see if these proteins are associated with a known cell type. Instead of querying HPA multiple times you can load your list in HPAStainR which will return a ranked table of the cell types with the most protein staining.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:16:06Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-30T12:06:04Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HPAStainR","home":"https://bio.tools/hpastainr","summary":"A Bioconductor and Shiny app to query protein expression patterns in the Human Protein Atlas.\n\nHPAStainR package to be submitted to Bioconductor.\n\nHPAStain.R is an R package/Shiny app used to query the Human Protein Atlas for staining data.
