FastBMD is a computationally efficient implementation of the National Toxicology Program Approach to Genomic Dose-Response Modeling. Key features include a simplified workflow, ability to download results at each step, and interactive exploration of pathway-level BMDs. In addition to model organisms, FastBMD is designed to support non-model organisms by enabling an annotation-free pipeline that includes feature sensitivity-based point-of-departure analysis. The final part of the analysis is designed to allow users to interactively explore BMDs at different levels of organization:.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:27:32Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:39:38.814062Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FastBMD","home":"https://bio.tools/fastbmd","summary":"FastBMD is an online tool for rapid benchmark dose-response analysis of transcriptomics data.
