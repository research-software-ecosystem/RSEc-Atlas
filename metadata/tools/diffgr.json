Briefly, DiffGR utilizes the stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), which can effectively eliminate the genomic-distance effect in Hi-C data, to measure the similarity of local genomic regions between two contact matrices, and then applies a nonparametric permutation test on those SCC values to detect genomic regions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:57:04Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-01T08:54:07Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DiffGR","home":"https://bio.tools/diffgr","summary":"DiffGR is a statistical method for detecting differential genomic regions at TAD level between two Hi-C contact maps.
