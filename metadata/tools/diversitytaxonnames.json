DTN is also used to organise common names in various languages and regional taxon checklists with information on red list status and other taxon-based (ecological and nature conservation) parameters.","addition_date":"2019-06-13T14:23:38Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","tool_type":["Desktop application","Web API","Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DiversityTaxonNames","home":"https://bio.tools/DiversityTaxonNames","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"DiversityTaxonNames (DWB-DTN) is an application of Diversity Workbench (DWB).
