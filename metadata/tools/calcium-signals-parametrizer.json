Signals are decomposed into drift and response components and the entirety of the signal is reconstructed using a mathematical model of a transient response and drift. Measures time of onset, activation time (10% to 90% of total amplitude),amplitude of response, full width at half maximum, decay time constant.","addition_date":"2021-05-05T10:47:34Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-07T13:54:50Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.1.1"],"collections":["File Exchange","MATLAB"]}}}
