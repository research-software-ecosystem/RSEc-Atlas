Additionally to the prediction itself, a prediction profile is computed which allows for determining the strengths to which the individual residues are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles can also be visualized as curves or heatmaps.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:00:28Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-30T15:49:53Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["2.2.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"procoil","home":"https://bio.tools/procoil","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"2.2.0","summary":"The package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence (amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form a dimer or more likely to form a trimer.
