ProteinLens constructs a fully atomistic, energy-weighted graph representation of a biomolecular structure and explores the long-range communication or connectivity between any specific sites in the system. Example of usage are identify potential allosteric sites, explore allosteric pathways, and identify residues that play a key role in signalling and/or cooperativity.","addition_date":"2021-11-29T07:27:17.195171Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:15:51.133630Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ProteinLens","home":"https://bio.tools/proteinlens","license":"CC-BY-NC-4.0","summary":"ProteinLens is a web-based application for the analysis of allosteric signalling on atomistic graphs of biomolecules.
