The algorithm searches all pre-defined gene classes for classes that exhibit a strong clustering of the samples. These are then used to split the samples in two groups until no significant splits can be found. The result is visualized as a tree with gene classes as nodes and groups of samples as leaves.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:38:04Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:04:51.758162Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CAPIU","home":"https://bio.tools/capiu","summary":"Novel approach for clustering samples (treatments, patients, condition etc) by using annotational information about the genes.
