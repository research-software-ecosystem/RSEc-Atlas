The only difference is that our tool uses symmetric cutoffs, while SAM uses asymmetric cutoffs. Therefore, for some datasets, all significant genes obtained by SAM are either all up-regulated or all down-regulated, but npSeq almost always gives significant genes that include both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T19:07:33Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:50Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
