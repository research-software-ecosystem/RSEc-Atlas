The 'general' gradient boost model is able to generalize well and is intended to be used on organisms not well represented in GenBank or RefSeq (roughly, when an organism is novel at the level of order, class or phylum). The 'specific' neural network model is more accurate when predicting completeness of organisms more closely related to the reference training set (roughly, when an organism belongs to a known species, genus or family). CheckM2 uses a cosine similarity calculation to automatically determine the appropriate completeness model for each input genome, but you can also force the use of a particular completeness model, or get the prediction outputs for both. There is only one contamination model (based on gradient boost) which is applied regardless of taxonomic novelty and works well across all cases.","addition_date":"2025-04-08T11:23:25.060891Z","last_update_date":"2025-04-08T11:23:25.063938Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["NFDI4Microbiota"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CheckM2","home":"https://bio.tools/checkm2","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Rapid assessment of genome bin quality using machine learning.\n\nCheckM2 uses two distinct machine learning models to predict genome completeness.
