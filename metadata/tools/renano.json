RENANO improves on its state of the art predecessor ENANO, by providing a more efficient base call sequence compression component. Two compression algorithms are introduced, corresponding to the following scenarios: (1) a reference genome is available without cost to both the compressor and the decompressor; (2) the reference genome is available only on the compressor side, and a compacted version of the reference is included in the compressed file.","addition_date":"2021-11-29T09:59:46.613233Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-29T09:59:46.615871Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RENANO","home":"https://bio.tools/renano","license":"MIT","summary":"RENANO is a reference-based lossless FASTQ data compressor, specifically tailored to compress FASTQ files generated with nanopore sequencing technologies.
