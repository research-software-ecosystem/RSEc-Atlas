We implemented a command-line tool mHapTools for converting BAM/SAM files from existing platforms to mHap files as well as postprocessing DNA methylation in mHap format. With this tool, we pro-cessed all publicly available human reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data and provided as a comprehensive mHap database.","addition_date":"2021-11-06T18:23:10.278896Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-06T18:23:10.281584Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"mHapTools","home":"https://bio.tools/mhaptools","license":"MIT","summary":"A simple DNA methylation haplotype format for storing DNA methylation BS-seq data.
