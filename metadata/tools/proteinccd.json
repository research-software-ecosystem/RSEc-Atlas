From input DNA sequence, information on disorder, coiled coils, transmembrane segments, domains and domain linkers are collected from secondary structure prediction servers. Users can select starts and ends for protein constructs and ProteinCCD wil design suitable PCR primers.","addition_date":"2017-02-14T09:35:42Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:35:07.523911Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"The Protein Crystallisation Construct Designer","home":"https://bio.tools/proteinccd","summary":"Protein Crystallographic Construct Design (Protein CCD) is a meta-web server that facilitates the design of several truncated constructs of a protein using experimental data or sequence analysis tools.
