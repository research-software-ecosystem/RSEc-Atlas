The long reads could be downloaed from public read archive database (for instance, NCBI SRA database ) or be your own data. Then they are fragmented and aligned to scaffolds using BWA mem algorithm in BWA package. In the package, we provided a compiled bwa, so the user needn't to install bwa. LR_Gapcloser uses the alignments to find the bridging that cross the gap, and then fills the long read original sequence into the genomic gaps.","addition_date":"2022-03-21T12:57:42.233738Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:10:48.268221Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LR_Gapcloser","home":"https://bio.tools/lrgapcloser","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"LR_Gapcloser is a gap closing tool using long reads from studied species.
