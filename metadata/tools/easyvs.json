With an intuitive interface, the tool allows users to go from selecting a protein target with a know structure and tailoring a purchasable molecule library to performing and visualising docking in a few clicks. Our system also allows users to filter screening libraries based on molecule properties, cluster molecules by similarity and personalise docking parameters.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:12:09Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-04T07:37:10Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EasyVS","home":"https://bio.tools/easyvs","summary":"A user-friendly web-based tool for molecule library selection and structure-based virtual screening.\n\nVirtual Screening in just a few clicks.\n\nEasyVS is a web-based platform built to simplify molecule library selection and virtual screening.
