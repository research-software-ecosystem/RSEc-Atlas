The main purpose of this program is to predict phage hosts from sequence in FASTA format. Currently we are able to predict 8 host genera with very high accuracy (around 97%). These genera are Arthrobacter, Escherichia, Gordonia, Lactococcus, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus.\n\nPHERI uses preprocessed data stored in the folder files. The whole preprocessing pipeline can be found here.\n\nTo install this tool please use our docker image.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:04:32Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-23T14:47:21Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PHERI","home":"https://bio.tools/pheri","license":"MIT","summary":"Phage Host Exploration pipeline.\n\nThis repository is the source code of bioinformatics pipeline, which creates files used in Pheri program.
