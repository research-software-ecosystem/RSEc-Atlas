The model includes an exchangeable prior for the variances which allow different variances for the genes but still shrink extreme empirical variances. Our model can be used for testing DE genes among multiple samples. Parameter estimation is carried out using a novel version of Markov Chain Monte Carlo.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:01:57Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:55:04.366252Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.38.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"bridge","home":"https://bio.tools/bridge","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.38.0","summary":"This package fits a Bayesian hierarchical model for testing DE genes from microarray data, modelling outliers using a t-distribution.
