ClusterMine (1) uses piror gene sets that often contain a set of functionally related genes to partition gene expression data into gene-set-wise subdata, (2) perform clustering analysis for each subdata, and (3) combine the clustering results of all subdata into a final clustering as the output.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:54:42Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:43:58.302345Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"ClusterMine","home":"https://bio.tools/clustermine","summary":"A knowledge-integrated clustering approach based on expression profiles of gene sets.\n\nClusterMine is a knowledge-integrated clustering approach to cluster samples based on gene expression profile.
