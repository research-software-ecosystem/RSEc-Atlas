Moreover, although non-A nucleotides can be incorporated in poly(A) tails, there also exists no method to accurately sequence them. Here, we present full-length poly(A) and mRNA sequencing (FLAM-seq), a rapid and simple method for high-quality sequencing of entire mRNAs. We report a complementary DNA library preparation method coupled to single-molecule sequencing to perform FLAM-seq. Using human cell lines, brain organoids and Caenorhabditis elegans we show that FLAM-seq delivers high-quality full-length mRNA sequences for thousands of different genes per sample","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:24:39Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-29T09:15:22Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FLAM-seq analysis pipeline","home":"https://bio.tools/FLAM-seq","summary":"A  full-length mRNA sequencing reveals principles of poly(A) tail length control | Although messenger RNAs are key molecules for understanding life, until now, no method has existed to determine the full-length sequence of endogenous mRNAs including their poly(A) tails.
