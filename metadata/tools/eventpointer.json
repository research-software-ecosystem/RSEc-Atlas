The algorithm can be used to analyze data from either junction arrays or sequencing data. The algorithm can generate a series of files to visualize the detected alternative splicing events in IGV. This eases the interpretation of results and the design of primers for standard PCR validation.","addition_date":"2018-07-08T15:34:33Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:34:46.055223Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EventPointer","home":"https://bio.tools/eventpointer","license":"Artistic-2.0","version":"1.4.0","summary":"It identifies alternative splicing events that involve either simple or complex experimental designs such as time course experiments and studies including paired-samples.
