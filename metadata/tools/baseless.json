BaseLess reduces your MinION sequencing device to a simple species detector. As a trade-off, it runs on inexpensive computational hardware like single-board computers. The neural network it uses is a composite of many smaller networks, each detecting a different k-mer, thus reconfiguration of baseLess to detect a different sequence amounts to combining different smaller networks.","addition_date":"2023-08-02T07:47:53.695056Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:45:17.307072Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"baseLess","home":"https://bio.tools/baseless","license":"MIT","summary":"Lightweight detection of sequences in raw MinION data.
