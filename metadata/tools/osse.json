The base values are set for the conventionally used significance level of 5% at 80% power, with minor allele frequencies of 15% and 7% in cases and controls, respectively. This estimates the necessary sample size in the setting of a pilot study, with unknown actual minor allele frequencies.","addition_date":"2017-03-05T12:13:28Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:22Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["Rare Disease"]}}}
