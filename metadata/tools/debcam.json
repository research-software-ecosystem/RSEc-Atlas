It provides basic functions to perform unsupervised deconvolution on mixture expression profiles by Convex Analysis of Mixtures (CAM) and some auxiliary functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific results. It also implements functions to perform supervised deconvolution based on prior knowledge of molecular markers, S matrix or A matrix. Combining molecular markers from CAM and from prior knowledge can achieve semi-supervised deconvolution of mixtures.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:02:03Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-22T16:28:27Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"debCAM","home":"https://bio.tools/debcam","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"debCAM is an R package for fully unsupervised deconvolution of complex tissues.
