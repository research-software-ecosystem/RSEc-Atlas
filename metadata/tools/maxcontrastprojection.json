Maximum intensity projections are a popular method to determine the focal plane of each pixel in the image. The problem with this approach, however, is that out-of-focus elements will still be visible, making edges and fine structures difficult to detect. This package aims to resolve this problem.","addition_date":"2018-07-12T10:23:31Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
