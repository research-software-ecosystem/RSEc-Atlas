Despite all past efforts, we still lack high-quality PPI data for constructing the networks, which makes it challenging to study the functions of association of proteins. High-throughput experimental techniques have produced abundant data for systematically studying the cellular networks of a biological system and the development of computational method for PPI identification.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:41:32Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-14T08:30:38Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iPPI-deepL","home":"https://bio.tools/iPPI-deepL","summary":"A deep learning framework for improving protein interaction prediction using sequence properties.\n\nAbstract Motivation Almost all critical functions and processes in cells are sustained by the cellular networks of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), understanding these is therefore crucial in the investigation of biological systems.
