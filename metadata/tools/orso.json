ORSO performs this task by creating and maintaining a network of datasets connected based on similarity in primary read coverage values and annotated metadata. An ORSO user can follow these connections to discover datasets with similar characteristics. ORSO is also a social network. Users may favorite datasets and follow other users, creating new connections that influence how datasets are recommended.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T06:59:33Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-15T09:37:43Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ORSO","home":"https://bio.tools/orso","license":"MIT","summary":"A data-driven social network connecting scientists to genomics datasets.\nORSO (Online Resource for Social Omics) is a web application designed to help users find next generation sequencing (NGS) datasets relevant to their research interests.
