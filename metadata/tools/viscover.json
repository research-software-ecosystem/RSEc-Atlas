Our data are measures of sheet and rill erosion called Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation - 2 (RUSLE2). Small area estimates of mean RUSLE2 erosion are of interest. We use a zero-inflated lognormal mixed effects model for small area estimation. The model combines a unit-level lognormal model for the positive RUSLE2 responses with a unit-level logistic mixed effects model for the binary indicator that the response is nonzero. In the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) data, counties with a higher probability of nonzero responses also tend to have a higher mean among the positive RUSLE2 values. We capture this property of the data through an assumption that the pair of random effects for a county are correlated","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:08:56Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-13T15:00:33Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"viscover","home":"https://bio.tools/viscover","summary":"Empirical Bayes small area prediction under a zero-inflated lognormal model with correlated random area effects.\n\nMany variables of interest in agricultural or economical surveys have skewed distributions and can equal zero.
