Despite the popularity and success of these methods, they have limited capabilities, particularly in situations in which the T-DNA is truncated. Here, we present a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform to facilitate the identification of complete and truncated T-DNA insertions. Our method enables the detection of the corresponding T-DNA insertion orientation and zygosity as well as insertion annotation. This method, called TDNAscan, was developed to be an open source software","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:19:13Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-27T15:15:53Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TDNAscan","home":"https://bio.tools/TDNAscan","summary":"> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Software to Identify Complete and Truncated T-DNA Insertions | Transfer (T)-DNA insertions in mutants isolated from forward genetic screens are typically identified through thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR), inverse PCR, or plasmid rescue.
