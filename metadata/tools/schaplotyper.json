However, the methods of haplotyping that are suitable for single cells are limited because a whole genome amplification (WGA) process is performed before sequencing or genotyping in PGD, and true haplotype profiles of embryos need to be constructed based on genotypes that can contain many WGA artifacts. RESULTS:Here, we offer scHaplotyper as a genetic diagnosis tool that reconstructs and visualizes the haplotype profiles of single cells based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). scHaplotyper can trace the origin of each haplotype block in the embryo, enabling the detection of carrier status of disease alleles in each embryo.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:31:50Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T17:53:19Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"scHaplotyper","home":"https://bio.tools/schaplotyper","summary":"haplotype construction and visualization for genetic diagnosis using single cell DNA sequencing data.\n\nHaplotyping reveals chromosome blocks inherited from parents to in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), enabling the observation of the transmission of disease alleles between generations.
