By means of the library, it is possible to model dynamical systems both at continuous and at discrete time. Moreover, the library comprises a set of regression algorithms for inferring MP models starting from time series of observations.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:51:53Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:54:37.240742Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MpTheory","home":"https://bio.tools/mptheory","summary":"Collects a set of Java objects and algorithms for modeling observed dynamics by means of the Metabolic P (MP) theory, that is, a discrete mathematical theory based on P systems, introduced by Prof. Vincenzo Manca in 2004 for modeling biological dynamics.
