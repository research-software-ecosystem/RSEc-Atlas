The ambiguity is caused by duplicated or similar alleles which are shared among different genes. The second tool is an allele based genotype, that determined the presence of an allele based on a threshold derived from a naive population.","addition_date":"2024-03-22T16:35:28.645917Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:06:55.876434Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PIgLET","home":"https://bio.tools/piglet","summary":"PIgLET is a suite of computational tools that improves genotype inference and downstream AIRR-seq data analysis.
