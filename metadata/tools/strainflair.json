StrainFLAIR is sub-divided into two main parts: first, an indexing step that stores clusters of reference genes into variation graphs, and then, a query step using mapping of metagenomic reads to infere strain-level abundances in the queried sample. The input for indexation is a collection of complete genomes, draft genomes or metagenome-assembled genomes from which genes will be predicted. The input for query is the so-created graph and any read file.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:59:07Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-10T09:24:08Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"StrainFLAIR","home":"https://bio.tools/strainflair","license":"AGPL-3.0","summary":"Strain-level profiling of metagenomic samples using variation graphs.\n\nStrainFLAIR (STRAIN-level proFiLing using vArIation gRaph) is a tool for strain identification and quantification that uses variation graph representation of genes sequences.
