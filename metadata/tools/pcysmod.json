Protein cysteine modifications mainly include thiol oxidation and palmitoylation of thioesterification reaction, which lead to a cascade of biochemical reactions. There are many types of cysteine modifications mediated by thiol groups, such as S-nitrosylation, S-sulfhydration, S-sulfenylation and S-sulfinylation. Besides, S-palmitoylation is cysteine modification through thioesterification reaction. These modifications lead to a cascade of biochemical reactions, and regulate various physiological and pathological processes, such as autophagy, redox homeostasis and cell signaling, demonstrating a closely relationship with many human diseases including cancers and diabetes and so on.","addition_date":"2021-11-01T11:45:25.334401Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-01T11:45:25.336910Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"pCysMod","home":"https://bio.tools/pcysmod","summary":"pCysMod is a tool for the prediction of multiple cysteine modification based on deep learning framework.
