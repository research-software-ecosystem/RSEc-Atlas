The SNP matrix includes the following features: (1) multiple line representation of multiallelic sites, (2) multiple line represention for SNPs present in overlapping genes, and (3) choice over the reference allele. Additionally, users can collapse SNPs into genes so the output is a binary gene matrix. Output from the prewas package should be used as the input to bacterial GWAS tools such as hogwash.
