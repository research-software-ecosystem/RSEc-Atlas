Pycabnn is for setting up a structural basis of a model, such as placing neurons in space and determine their connectivity, based on anatomical constraints. It is primarily developed for a model of the granular layer in the cerebellar cortex [1]. However, we tried to make it as adaptable as possible to other circuit models.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:23:26Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-30T14:43:21Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"pycabnn","home":"https://bio.tools/pycabnn","license":"MIT","summary":"Efficient and Extensible Software to Construct an Anatomical Basis for a Physiologically Realistic Neural Network Model.\n\nPycabnn (Python tool for Constructing an Anatomical Basis of a Neural Network; pronounce it as \"pie cabin\") is a Python 3 package to aid building a physiologically realistic neural network model.
