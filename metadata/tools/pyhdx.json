Most HDX-MS experiments compare protein states (e.g. apoprotein vs liganded) and provide detailed information on differential dynamics between them obtained from multiple overlapping peptides. However, differential dynamics are difficult to compare across protein derivatives, oligomeric assemblies, homologues and samples treated under different buffer and protease conditions.
