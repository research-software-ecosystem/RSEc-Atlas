The structure prediction is accomplished by either comparative modelling or the de novo Rosetta fragment insertion method. Interface alanine scanning is employed to predict how protein-protein interactions could be affected by mutations.","addition_date":"2017-03-24T10:46:34Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:55Z","tool_type":["Web application"]}}}
