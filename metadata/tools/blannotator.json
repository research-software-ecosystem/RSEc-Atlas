The tool accepts DNA or protein sequences, given in FASTA-format, and performs a Blast homology search against UniProtKB databases. Matching sequences with similar annotations are merged into families of similar descriptions, which are, in turn, further unified, based on assigned GO-profiles retrieved from GOA, into sets of functionally equivalent sequences. As a result, a reliable description will be obtained.","addition_date":"2017-05-16T12:28:19Z","last_update_date":"2019-03-26T08:12:42Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["Proteomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BLANNOTATOR","home":"https://bio.tools/blannotator","summary":"Blannotator is a rapid tool for functional prediction of gene or proteins sequences.
