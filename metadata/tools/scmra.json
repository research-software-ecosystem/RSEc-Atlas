Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to resolve cellular heterogeneity. After collecting scRNA-seq data, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulated data to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. Thus, an effective and efficient cell-type identification method is urgently needed. Meanwhile, high quality reference data remain a necessity for precise annotation. However, such tailored reference data are always lacking in practice. To address this, we aggregated multiple datasets into a meta-dataset on which annotation is conducted.","addition_date":"2022-03-28T13:04:54.064055Z","last_update_date":"2022-03-28T13:04:54.066547Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"scMRA","home":"https://bio.tools/scmra","summary":"scMRA is a robust deep learning method to annotate scRNA-seq data with multiple reference datasets.
