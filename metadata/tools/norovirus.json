We investigated the epidemiology of noroviruses in outpatient children from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, China. METHODS:Stool specimens were collected between January 2012 and December 2017 from 1433 children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis. All samples were analysed by conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for genogroup II NoVs amplifying both the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and partial capsid genes","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:47:35Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T08:54:23Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Norovirus","home":"https://bio.tools/Norovirus","summary":"Genetic diversity and epidemiology of Genogroup II noroviruses in children with acute sporadic gastroenteritis in Shanghai, China, 2012-2017 | BACKGROUND:Noroviruses (NoVs) are considered an important cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) across all age groups, especially in children under 5 years of age.
