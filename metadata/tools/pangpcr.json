Moreover, potential side effects collected from the SIDER (Side-Effect Resource) database and mapped to 45 tissues and organs are provided by linking predicted off-targets and their expressed sequence tag profiles. With PanGPCR, multiple targets, repurposing potential and side effects can be determined by simply uploading a small ligand.","addition_date":"2023-08-30T12:13:35.064036Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:16:24.373199Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["gpcr"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PanGPCR","home":"https://bio.tools/pangpcr","summary":"PanGPCR docks the compound of interest to a library of 36 experimentally determined crystal structures comprising of 46 docking sites for human GPCRs, and a ranked list is generated from the docking studies to assess all GPCRs and their binding affinities.
