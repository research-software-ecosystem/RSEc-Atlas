We collected 617,462 unique smORFs from previous studies for searching. By re-annotating microarray probes to smORFs, we estimated smORF expressions for 173 datasets in GEO. Functions can further be predicted by co-expression genes of smORF. In this tool, we provide function predictions for 526,443 of these smORFs in at most 265 models, 48 tissues/cells, 82 diseases (and normal).\n\nA Tool for Small Open Reading Frame (smORF) / Microprotein Function Prediction.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:51:31Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T16:56:38Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"smORFunction","home":"https://bio.tools/smorfunction","summary":"A Tool for Predicting Functions of Small Open Reading Frames and Microproteins.\n\nsmORFunction is a tool for small open reading frame (smORF) and microprotein function prediction.
