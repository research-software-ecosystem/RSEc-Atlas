If signal peptide is found, it also checks if the signal peptide carries toxic proteins or is from fungi. This is done using 5 random forest model at each detection step. Consequently, we have 5 scores for each step.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:17:47Z","last_update_date":"2021-12-13T09:40:35.230248Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Razor","home":"https://bio.tools/razor","summary":"Annotating eukaryotic and toxin-specific signal peptides using Razor.\n\nRazor is a tool to detect signal peptides for eukaryotic protein sequences. \n\nOptimise your protein coding sequences using smarter tools and algorithms!.\n\nRazor detects signal peptide in the given sequence.
