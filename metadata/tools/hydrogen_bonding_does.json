The positioning of synonymous codons within coding sequences (CDSs) dictates protein expression by mechanisms such as local translation efficiency, mRNA Gibbs free energy, and protein co-translational folding. In this work, we explore how codon variants affect the position-dependent content of hydrogen bonding, which in turn influences energy requirements for unwinding double-stranded DNA. By analyzing over 14,000 bacterial, archaeal, and fungal ORFeomes, we found that Bacteria and Archaea exhibit an exponential ramp of hydrogen bonding at the 5\u2032-end of CDSs, while a similar ramp was not found in Fungi. The ramp develops within the first 20 codon positions in prokaryotes, eventually reaching a steady carrying capacity of hydrogen bonding that does not differ from Fungi","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:27:19Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-11T08:02:43Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Hydrogen bonding does","home":"https://bio.tools/hydrogen_bonding_does","summary":"Codon usage bias creates a ramp of hydrogen bonding at the 5\u2032-end in prokaryotic ORFeomes.\n\nCodon usage bias exerts control over a wide variety of molecular processes.
