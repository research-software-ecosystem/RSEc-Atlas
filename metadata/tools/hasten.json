Glide from Schrodinger is supported in this version, but the same applies here: it should be easy to plug-in your own docking program. Do note that the HASTEN assumes that the smaller the docking score, the better the score.\n\nThere is also simulation mode, which allows you to run benchmarks using existing docking_scores without in reality doing anything in 3D. This mode can be useful when adjusting the machine learning parameters.","addition_date":"2021-11-22T14:18:53.249905Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-22T14:18:53.252584Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HASTEN","home":"https://bio.tools/hasten","license":"Other","summary":"HASTEN is a tool that makes it easier to run machine learning boosted virtual screening workflows.
