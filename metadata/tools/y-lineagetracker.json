Y-LineageTracker provides a framework to fully analyze human Y-chromosome sequencing data. Y-LineageTracker supports most of analyses of Y-chromosome sequencing data and facilitates subsequent studies of NRY haplogroups and Y-STRs. In brief, analyses of NRY haplogroup include haplogroup classification, clustering, phylogeny construction and estimating divergence time of haplogroups, and analyses of Y-STR include Y-STR genotyping, statistical analysis, network analysis and estimating TMRCA of Y-STR haplotypes.","addition_date":"2022-01-03T07:43:44.017144Z","last_update_date":"2022-01-03T07:43:44.019838Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Y-LineageTracker","home":"https://bio.tools/y-lineagetracker","summary":"Y-LineageTracker is a high-throughput analysis framework for Y-chromosomal next-generation sequencing data.
