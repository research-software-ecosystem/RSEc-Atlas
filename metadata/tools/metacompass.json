MetaCompass achieves comparable assembly performance to the state of the art de novo assemblers, but these two different approaches complement each other a lot. So combining contigs between MetaCompass and other independent de novo assemblers give us the best overall metagenomic assembly.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:09:19Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0"]}}}
