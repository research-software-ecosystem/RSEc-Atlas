So far, tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches based on immune-specific marker genes or expression signature. Therefore, we systematically explored the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and identified immunity quantitative trait loci (immunQTLs) across 33 cancer types from TCGA.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:26:15Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:45:00.215884Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"CancerImmunityQTL","home":"https://bio.tools/cancerimmunityqtl","summary":"CancerImmunityQTL is a database to systematically evaluate the impact of genetic variants on immune infiltration in human cancer.\n\nTumor-infiltrating immune cells, as the component of tumor microenvironment, could influence tumor progress, prognosis and response to therapy profoundly.
