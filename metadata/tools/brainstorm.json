Our objective is to share a comprehensive set of user-friendly tools with the scientific community using MEG/EEG as an experimental technique. For physicians and researchers, the main advantage of Brainstorm is its rich and intuitive graphic interface, which does not require any programming knowledge. We are also putting the emphasis on practical aspects of data analysis (e.g., with scripting for batch analysis and intuitive design of analysis pipelines) to promote reproducibility and productivity in MEG/EEG research. Finally, although Brainstorm is developed with Matlab (and Java), it does not require users to own a Matlab license: an executable, platform-independent (Windows, MacOS, Linux) version is made available in the downloadable package.","addition_date":"2023-01-23T15:59:58.699094Z","last_update_date":"2023-05-01T11:29:59.769949Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Brainstorm","home":"https://bio.tools/brainstorm","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Brainstorm is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings:\nMEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and multiunit electrophysiology.
