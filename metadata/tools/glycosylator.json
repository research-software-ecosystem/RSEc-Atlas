It can be used directly in a Python script through its API or through its Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward 2D rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the gylcosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific 3D glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. Glycosylator has been implemented in a generic way allowing the user to expand the library to incorporate other polymers","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:37:56Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-03T12:01:10Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Glycosylator","home":"https://bio.tools/Glycosylator","summary":"a Python framework for the rapid modeling of glycans.\n\nFramework for the rapid modeling glycans and glycoproteins.\n\nGlycosylator is a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure.
