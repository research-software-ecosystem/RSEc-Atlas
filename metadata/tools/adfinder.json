ADFinder can predict programmed DNA eliminations with relatively low sequencing coverage, detect multiple alternative splicing forms in the same genomic location, and calculate the frequency for each splicing event. This software would facilitate research of programmed DNA eliminations and all down-stream analyses.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:31:56Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-21T13:24:31Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ADFinder","home":"https://bio.tools/adfinder","summary":"ADFinder is an efficient detector of programmed DNA eliminations using NGS high-throughput sequencing data.
