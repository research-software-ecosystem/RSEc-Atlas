It allows remote scheduling of pre-defined pipelines, as well as re-scheduling queued jobs. Moreover, output files are rendered in HTML in real time, allowing the use of markdown and rich-text features. Telescope does not assume anything from the remote server, except for SSH connection. The connection is established using SSH key pairs that are stored after encrypted.","addition_date":"2019-11-19T23:25:50Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:19:46.204861Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Telescope","home":"https://bio.tools/Telescope","summary":"Telescope is an open-source web application that tracks the progress of jobs submitted to remote servers using Sun Grid Engine (SGE) on-demand scheduling system.
