CorRelator is an interactive and flexible toolkit for high-precision cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy. CorRelator supports both on-the-fly and post-acquisition two dimensional (2D) cryo-correlation. The on-the-fly correlation integrates image registration, transformation and correlation between EM and FM. The output is ready for SerialEM automated data collection at transformed fluorescent targets of interest (TOIs) on registered EM images. To get started and gain supports, visit Wiki for more details.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:19:15Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-17T16:02:54Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CorRelator","home":"https://bio.tools/correlator","license":"MIT","summary":"CorRelator is a tool for easy TEM and FLM correlation for On-The-Fly processing.
