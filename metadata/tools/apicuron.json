Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data - mainly from literature - requires a huge effort which is difficult to quantify and acknowledge. APICURON collects biocuration events from third party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:57:41Z","last_update_date":"2022-02-10T15:24:22.468192Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"APICURON","home":"https://bio.tools/apicuron","summary":"APICURON is an open resource that tracks and credits the work of biocurators across multiple participating knowledgebases.
