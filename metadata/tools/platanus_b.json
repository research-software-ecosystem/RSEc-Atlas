(2) It also can accept Oxford-Nanopore and/or PacBio long reads (\"iterate\" command). (3) Implementing the iteration of sequence-extensions, gap-closing and error-removals, it can archive assemblies with contiguity and accuracy for many cases. (4) As an utility function, it can combine multiple assemblies through the \"combine\" command.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:04:42Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-24T07:52:48Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Platanus_B","home":"https://bio.tools/platanus_b","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"PLATform for Assembling NUcleotide Sequences.\nThis is an accurate de novo assembler for bacterial genomes using an iterative error-removal process.\n\nPlatanus_B is a de novo assembler for isolated bacterial genomes.
