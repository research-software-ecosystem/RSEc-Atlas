METHODS:A total of 2647 patients diagnosed with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from 1998 to 2014 were extracted from the SEER database. We used the Lasso Cox regression model to identify independent risk factors for long-term survival and to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator. RESULTS:The median (mean) follow-up time was 30 months (52.8 months). Cancer-specific survival rates decreased with time, while the 5-year conditional survival increased with time","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:47:07Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T08:44:23Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"nomogram","home":"https://bio.tools/nomogram","summary":"Dynamic prediction of long-term survival in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | BACKGROUND:This study investigated a large number of patients to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator that can dynamically predict the long-term survival of patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
