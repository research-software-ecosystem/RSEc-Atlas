It extracts distribution features of nearby epigenomic markers, like histone modification or nucleosome occupancy, to help de novo find motif, thus rendering a higher level of accuracy on characterizing motif (cross-validated by ChIP-seq data) and more co-factors.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:08:56Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.5"]}}}
