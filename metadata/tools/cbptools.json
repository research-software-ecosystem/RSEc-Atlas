It currently supports two modalities: resting-state functional connectivity and structural connectivity based on diffusion-weighted imaging, along with support for custom connectivity matrices. Analysis parameters are customizable and the workflow can be scaled to a large number of subjects using a parallel processing environment. Parcellation results with corresponding validity metrics are provided as textual and graphical output. Regional connectivity-based parcellation (rCBP) is a widely used procedure for investigating the structural and functional differentiation within a region of interest (ROI) based on its long-range connectivity.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:02:51Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-09T07:50:12Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CBPtools","home":"https://bio.tools/cbptools","license":"Freeware","summary":"CBPtools is a Python package that allows users to run an extensively evaluated rCBP analysis workflow on a given ROI.
