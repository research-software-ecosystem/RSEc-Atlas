The goal of CCmed is to provide computationally efficient tools to conduct cross-condition mediation analysis. CCmed identifies trans-associations mediated by cis-effects (e.g. trans-associations of eQTLs mediated by effects on cis-gene expression levels). Mediation analyses can be performed at the gene-level or used to identify trans-associations of complex trait GWAS SNPs/variants.","addition_date":"2021-06-14T12:44:05Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:20:16.559048Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CCmed","home":"https://bio.tools/ccmed","summary":"CCmed is a package for cross-condition mediation analysis for identifying replicable trans-associations mediated by cis-gene expression.
