Firstly, metaMIC extracts various types of features from the alignment between paired-end sequencing reads and the assembled contigs. Secondly, the features extracted in the first step will be used as input of a random forest classifier for identifying misassembled metagenomic assemblies. Thirdly, metaMIC will localize misassembly breakpoints for each misassembled contig and then correct misassemblies by splitting into parts at the breakpoints.","addition_date":"2021-11-06T21:43:06.739634Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-06T21:44:45.016916Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"metaMIC","home":"https://bio.tools/metamic","license":"MIT","summary":"metaMIC is a fully automated tool for identifying and correcting misassemblies of (meta)genomic assemblies with the following three steps.
