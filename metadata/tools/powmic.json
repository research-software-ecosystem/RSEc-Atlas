However, the complexity of microbiome data characteristics such as excessive zeros, over-dispersion, compositional effect, intrinsically microbial correlations and variable sequencing depths makes the power analysis particularly challenging as the analytical form is usually unavailable. Here, we develop a simulation-based strategy and R package powmic to estimate the empirical statistical power while considering the complexity of data characteristics.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:10:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-24T15:35:52Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"powmic","home":"https://bio.tools/powmic","summary":"an R package for power assessment in microbiome case-control studies.\n\npower assessment in microbiome case-control studies.\n\nPower analysis is essential to decide the sample size of metagenomic sequencing experiments in a case-control study for identifying differentially abundant microbes.
