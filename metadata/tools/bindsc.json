Previous methods such as Seurat, Liger, Harmony did not work on this case unless match feature empricallcy. For example, integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data requires to calculate the gene/promoter activity by counting peaks in gene body, which always loses information. This strategy also did not work on integrating scRNA-seq and cytof data becasue gene expression and protein abundance level is not always correlated due to sparsity of scRNA-seq data or post translational modification.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:20:45Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-04T12:24:05Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"bindSC","home":"https://bio.tools/bindsc","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"bindSC (Bi-order INtegration of multi-omics Data from Single Cell sequencing technologies) is an R package for single cell multi-omic integration analysis. bindSC is developed to address the challenge of single-cell multi-omic data integration that consists of unpaired cells measured with unmatched features across modalities.
