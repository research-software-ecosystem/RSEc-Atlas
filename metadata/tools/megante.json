Automatically runs several analysis and integrates the results to select the appropriate consensus exon-intron structures and to predict open reading frames (ORFs) at each locus. Functional annotation and a functional domain search, are also performed for the predicted ORFs. The resultant annotation information is visualized with GBrowse and the results can be downloaded in Microsoft Excel format.","addition_date":"2018-05-17T11:57:10Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MEGANTE","home":"https://bio.tools/megante","summary":"Perform genomic sequence annotations by uploading a sequence and selecting the species to query.
