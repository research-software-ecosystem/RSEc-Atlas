It allows precise, robust and automatic quantification of protein organization at different scales, from the cellular level down to clusters of a few fluorescent markers. It is insensitive to cell shape, molecular organization, background and noise, allowing comparing efficiently different biological conditions in a non-biased manner.","addition_date":"2016-09-12T13:56:46Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T14:11:09Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SR-Tesseler","home":"https://bio.tools/sr-tesseler","version":"1.0","summary":"This tool is an open-source segmentation software using Voronoi tessellation constructed from the coordinates of localized molecules.
