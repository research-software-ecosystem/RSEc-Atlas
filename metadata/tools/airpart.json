It makes use of a generalized fused lasso with binomial observations of allelic counts to partition cell types by their allelic imbalance. Alternatively, a nonparametric method for partitioning cell types is offered. The package includes a number of visualizations and quality control functions for examining single cell allelic imbalance datasets.","addition_date":"2022-03-28T07:31:25.794895Z","last_update_date":"2022-03-28T07:31:25.797473Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"airpart","home":"https://bio.tools/airpart","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"Airpart identifies sets of genes displaying differential cell-type-specific allelic imbalance across cell types or states, utilizing single-cell allelic counts.
