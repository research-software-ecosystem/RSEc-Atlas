RANDOMIZE is a user-friendly web application that provides an interactive and flexible graphical user interface (GUI) to randomize relevant metadata. Using this tool will minimize chip and position mediated batch effects in microarray studies for an increased validity in inferences from your methylation data. The tool is very helpful for biologist to perform randomization of test samples and insert controls in the data.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:47:08Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-03T14:08:05Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"RANDOMIZE","home":"https://bio.tools/randomize","summary":"A Web Server for Data Randomization.\n\nHigh-throughput DNA methylation arrays are susceptible to bias facilitated by batch effects and other technical noise that can alter DNA methylation level estimates.
