This is a likelihood-based approach which can perform hypothesis testing as well as estimation of disease-related marker relative risks under a case-parent design. This test uses nuclear family with a single affected proband and allows additional siblings and missing parental genotypes. This program can test both single marker and haplotypes association.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T19:04:35Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T16:11:02.077128Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"X-LRT","home":"https://bio.tools/x-lrt","summary":"Suite of family-based tests for detecting association of X-chromosome genes.
