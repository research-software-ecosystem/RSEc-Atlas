However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalising syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterise taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth CS) to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from the survey metadata.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:19:22Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-14T08:33:39Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ID-TaxER","home":"https://bio.tools/id-taxer","summary":"Integration of ecological responses to a soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene database.\n\nAbstract High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes.
