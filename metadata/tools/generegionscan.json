This can be used for analysis of variable splicing, and is especially well suited for use with exon-array data.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:01:25Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-29T13:59:20Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.30.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GeneRegionScan","home":"https://bio.tools/generegionscan","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.30.0","summary":"A package with focus on analysis of discrete regions of the genome using Affymetrix data, including additional information about the sequence of each probe and the probe set it is derived from.
