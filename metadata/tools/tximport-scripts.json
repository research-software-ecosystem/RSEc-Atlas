Functions R packages are hard to call when building workflows outside of R, so this package adds a set of simple wrappers with robust argument parsing. Intermediate steps are currently mainly serialized R objects, but the ultimate objective is to have language-agnostic intermediate formats allowing composite workflows using a variety of software packages."}}}
