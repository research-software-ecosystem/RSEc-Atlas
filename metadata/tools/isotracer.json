In these experiments, a labeled element is injected into a biological system and its fate is traced throughout the system to estimate the flux of matter across compartments. Tracer additions can be used across all levels of biological organization from cells and tissues, to organisms and ecosystems. The isotracer package provides tools to analyze data from such experiments.","addition_date":"2022-01-15T02:41:46.136998Z","last_update_date":"2022-01-15T02:41:46.139472Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"isotracer","home":"https://bio.tools/isotracer","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Isotope tracer addition experiments are used to answer a wide variety of biological, ecological and evolutionary questions.
