The system uses an OpenMV M7 microcontroller to acquire images of the arena and process them in real-time to report mouse centroid data to a text file. This data can be used as a measure of mouse movement (i.e speed and distance traveled) for various activity studies. This project is currently ongoing as we test and perfect the prototypes.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:36:49Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-03T15:25:29Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"RAT","home":"https://bio.tools/rat","summary":"A Machine Vision Rodent Tracking Camera and Closed Loop Control System.\n\nRAT is a low-cost system to track and report mouse activity while they are contained in a simple arena.
