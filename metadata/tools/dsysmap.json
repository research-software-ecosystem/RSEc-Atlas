It allows, for instance, to distinguish between changes that totally suppress a gene product (i.e. node removal) from the ones that might affect only one of its functions, modulating the way in which the protein interacts with its partners (i.e. edge-specific or edgetic1). dSysMap is a resource for the systematic mapping of disease-related missense mutations on the structurally annotated binary human interactome from Interactome3D.","addition_date":"2021-01-25T09:44:02Z","last_update_date":"2022-12-01T19:28:38.746338Z"}}}
