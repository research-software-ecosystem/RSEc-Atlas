It includes methods for constant-factor and bicriteria approximation solutions, as well as coreset sampling algorithms. These methods allow for fast and accurate summarization of and clustering of datasets with strong theoretical guarantees. Minicore both stands for \"mini\" and \"core\", as it builds concise representations via core-sets, and as a portmanteau of Manticore and Minotaur.","addition_date":"2021-10-10T14:33:01.588464Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-10T14:33:01.590927Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"minicore","home":"https://bio.tools/minicore","license":"MIT","summary":"Minicore is a fast, generic library for constructing and clustering coresets on graphs, in metric spaces and under non-metric dissimilarity measures.
