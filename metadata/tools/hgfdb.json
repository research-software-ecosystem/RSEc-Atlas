Because of the characteristics of the HGF, the study of HGF is valuable, so we conduct an improved domesticated HGF genome de novo assembly generated by long and short read sequencing together with optical and chromatin interaction mapping. Using this assembly as the reference, we performed population genomic analyses for newly sequenced whole-genomes for 129 birds including domesticated animals, wild progenitors, and closely related wild species. The data are important to provide valuable genetic resources for researchers and breeders to improve production in this species. For this purpose, we have developed a comprehensive and easy-to-use web-based database, HGFDB.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:31:40Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-30T09:45:30Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HGFDB","home":"https://bio.tools/hgfdb","summary":"A collective database of helmeted guinea fowl genomics.\n\nHelmeted guinea fowl (HGF; Numida meleagris) is vigorous, hardy, and mostly disease-free game birds.
