Some AMPs can target cancer cells; thus, they are called anticancer peptides (ACPs). Due to their small size, positive charge, hydrophobicity and amphipathicity, AMPs and ACPs interact with negatively charged components of biological membranes. AMPs preferentially permeabilize microbial membranes, but ACPs additionally target mitochondrial and plasma membranes of cancer cells.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:03:47Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-07T12:32:45Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CancerGram","home":"https://bio.tools/cancergram","summary":"CancerGram identifies anticancer peptides using random forests and n-gram encoding.\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute a diverse group of bioactive molecules that provide multicellular organisms with protection against microorganisms, and microorganisms with weaponry for competition.
