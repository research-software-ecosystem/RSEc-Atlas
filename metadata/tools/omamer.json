It is based on an innovative method using subfamily-informed k-mers for alignment-free mapping to ancestral protein subfamilies. Whilst able to reject non-homologous family-level assignments, it has provided better and quicker subfamily-level assignments than a method based on closest sequences (using DIAMOND).","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:58:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-13T19:05:20Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OMAmer","home":"https://bio.tools/omamer","summary":"Tree-driven and alignment-free protein assignment to subfamilies outperforms closest sequence approaches.\n\nOMAmer is a novel alignment-free protein family assignment method, which limits over-specific subfamily assignments and is suited to phylogenomic databases with thousands of genomes.
