The protocols is based on our Xlink Analyzer and external software: Integrative Modeling Plafform (IMP), Python Modeling Interface (PMI), UCSF Chimera, and imp-sampcon. Comparing to other methods, Assembline enables efficient sampling of conformational space through a multi-step procedure, provides new modeling restraints, and includes a unique configuration system for setting up the modelling project.","addition_date":"2021-06-14T13:06:23Z","last_update_date":"2021-08-13T08:44:20Z","tool_type":["Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Assembline","home":"https://bio.tools/assembline","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Assembline is a multi-step protocol for integrative structural modeling of macromolecular complexes based on electron microscopy, cross-linking mass spectrometry and other data.
