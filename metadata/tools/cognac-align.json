The main function identifies shared genes to be used as phylogenetic markers within the input set of genomes. Marker genes are aligned individually with mafft and concatenated into a single alignment for downstream phylogenetic analysis. The algorithm uses mutli-threading and several algorithmic tricks to improve speed and efficiency, which make cognac capable of generating core-gene alignments for thousands of genomes in only a few hours.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:12:22Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-14T16:43:00Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"cognac","home":"https://bio.tools/cognac-align","summary":"Cognac (COre GeNe Alignment Concatenation) is an R package for for generating concatenated gene alignments.
