Briefly, RBO fosters comparison of ranked lists of different lengths with heavier weights for matching the higher-ranking items. RBO ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the lists are disjoint (have no items in common) and 1 means that the lists are identical in content and order.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:36:52Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-28T09:42:12Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Phirbo","home":"https://bio.tools/phirbo","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Taxonomy-aware, sequence similarity ranking reliably predicts phage-host relationships.\n\nA tool to predict prokaryotic hosts for phage (meta)genomic sequences.
