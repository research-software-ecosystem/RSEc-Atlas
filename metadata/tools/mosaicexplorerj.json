As opposed to existing software, stitching does not require any prior information on the actual positions of the tiles, or conversion of raw TIFF images to a multi-resolution format for interactive exploration and fast processing. MosaicExplorerJ was specifically designed to process lightsheet microscopy datasets from optically cleared samples. It can handle multiple fluorescence channels, dual-sided lightsheet illumination and dual-sided camera detection.","addition_date":"2021-10-11T07:16:56.346142Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-11T07:17:53.985627Z","tool_type":["Plug-in"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MosaicExplorerJ","home":"https://bio.tools/mosaicexplorerj","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"MosaicExplorerJ is an ImageJ macro to stitch 3D tiles from terabyte-size microscopy datasets organized on a regular 2D grid.
