The subcellular proteome of T cells was mapped under steady state conditions, as well as upon 15 min and 1 h of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, respectively. We quantified the subcellular distribution of 6,572 proteins and identified a subset of 237 potentially translocating proteins, including both well-known examples and novel ones. Microscopic validation confirmed the localization of selected proteins with previously known and unknown localization, respectively.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:00:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-16T16:16:27Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TcellSubC","home":"https://bio.tools/TcellSubC","summary":"An Atlas of the Subcellular Proteome of Human T Cells.\n\nThis is a  curated an in-depth subcellular proteomic map of primary human CD4+ T cells, divided into cytosolic, nuclear and membrane fractions generated by an optimized fractionation and HiRIEF-LC-MS MS workflow for limited amounts of primary cells.
