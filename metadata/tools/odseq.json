Outlier sequences can make downstream analyses unreliable or make the alignments less accurate while they are being constructed. This package implements the OD-seq algorithm for aligned sequences and a variant using string kernels for unaligned sequences.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T14:57:41Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:32:18.195111Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.2.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"odseq","home":"https://bio.tools/odseq","license":"MIT","version":"1.2.0","summary":"Performs outlier detection of sequences in a multiple sequence alignment using bootstrap of predefined distance metrics.
