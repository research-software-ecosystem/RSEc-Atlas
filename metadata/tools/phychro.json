For each synteny breakpoint issued from pairwise genome comparisons, the algorithm defines two disjoint sets of genomes, named partial splits, respectively supporting the two block adjacencies defining the breakpoint. Considering all partial splits issued from all pairwise comparisons, a distance between two genomes is computed from the number of partial splits separating them. Tree reconstruction is achieved through a bottom-up approach by iteratively grouping sister genomes minimizing genome distances.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:36:56Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-09T15:33:48Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PhyChro","home":"https://bio.tools/PhyChro","license":"BSD-3-Clause","summary":"PhyChro is a reconstruction method based on chromosomal rearrangements, applicable to a wide range of eukaryotic genomes with different gene contents and levels of synteny conservation.
