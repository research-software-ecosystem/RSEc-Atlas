RWRF uses similarity network of samples as the basis for integration. It constructs the similarity network for each data type and then connects corresponding samples of multiple similarity networks to create a multiplex sample network. By applying RWR on the multiplex network, RWRF uses stationary probability distribution to fuse similarity networks.","addition_date":"2021-11-29T11:42:11.786991Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-29T11:42:11.789547Z","tool_type":["Suite"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RWRF","home":"https://bio.tools/rwrf","summary":"Random Walk with Restart for multi-dimensional data Fusion (RWRF).
