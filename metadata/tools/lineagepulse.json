LineagePulse accounts for batch effects, drop-out and variable sequencing depth. One can use LineagePulse to perform longitudinal differential expression analysis across pseudotime as a continuous coordinate or between discrete groups of cells. Expression model fits can be directly extracted from LineagePulse.","addition_date":"2018-07-11T12:00:45Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
