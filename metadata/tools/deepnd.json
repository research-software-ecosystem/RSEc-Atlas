Thus, the predictions for the disorders depend on each other's genetic architecture. The proposed DeepND architecture uses graph convolution to extract associations between genes from gene coexpression networks that model neurodevelopment. This information is processed by a mixture-of-experts model that can self-learn critical neurodevelopmental time windows and brain regions for each disorder etiology which makes the model interpretable. We provide a genomewide risk ranking for each disorder.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:31:12Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-27T14:36:24Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DeepND","home":"https://bio.tools/deepnd","summary":"DeepND is a cross-disorder gene discovery algorithm (Deep Neurodevelopmenal Disorders algorithm) It analyzes comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders simultaneously and explicitly learns the shared and disorder-specific genetic features using multitask learning.
