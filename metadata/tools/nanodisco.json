For microbiomes, nanodisco also supports the use of DNA methylation patterns as natural epigenetic barcodes to facilitate high resolution metagenomic binning. Specifically, nanodisco can be used to De novo discover DNA methylation motifs, identify specific type (6mA, 5mC or 4mC, namely typing) of a methylation motif, and identify which specific position within the motif is methylated (namely fine mapping), performing metagenomic binning based on microbial DNA methylation pattern by constructing and clustering a methylation profile matrix, and to integrate the two functionalities above together for de novo methylation motif discovery from microbiomes, and metagenomic analysis.","addition_date":"2021-10-25T06:10:40.849860Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-25T06:11:49.786333Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"nanodisco","home":"https://bio.tools/nanodisco","license":"CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0","summary":"nanodisco is a toolbox for de novo discovery of all the three types (6mA, 5mC and 4mC) of DNA methylation from individual bacteria and microbiomes using nanopore sequencing.
