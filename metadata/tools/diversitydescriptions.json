The states can be generalized to one of the presently supported data types (categorical states, quantitative values and measures, molecular sequence data and free-form text). The descriptors (=properties) are not limited to morphological characters and functional traits, but could be physiological, ecological, behavioral , survey parameters, molecular descriptors, descriptors of a lab workflow, descriptors of data content schemes. Sample data and measurement data as gained by ecological field sampling are addressed with own functions.","addition_date":"2019-06-12T18:27:45Z","last_update_date":"2022-08-24T14:38:42.504891Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DiversityDescriptions","home":"https://bio.tools/DiversityDescriptions","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"DiversityDescriptions (DWB-DD) is an application of the Diversity Workbench (DWB).
