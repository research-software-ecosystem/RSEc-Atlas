Many mathematical models have been developed to describe the choice behavior and response time (RT) distributions of observers performing decision-making tasks. However, relatively few researchers use these models because it demands expertise in various numerical, statistical, and software techniques. NEW METHOD:We present a toolbox - Choices and Response Times in R, or ChaRTr - that provides the user the ability to implement and test a wide variety of decision-making models ranging from classic through to modern versions of the diffusion decision model, to models with urgency signals, or collapsing boundaries.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:05:24Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-10T16:28:32Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"ChaRTr","home":"https://bio.tools/ChaRTr","summary":"An R toolbox for modeling choices and response times in decision-making tasks.\n\nBACKGROUND:Decision-making is the process of choosing and performing actions in response to sensory cues to achieve behavioral goals.
