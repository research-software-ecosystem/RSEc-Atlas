The permutations are divided across the multiple nodes. The computational workload is divided among multiple CPUs and the main memory of all participating computers is utilized to avoid caching operations to the disk, which significantly decrease algorithm execution time.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:10:44Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:46Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]}}}
