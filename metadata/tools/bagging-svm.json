As a different approach to traditional drug development, the machine learning algorithm is used to predict the drug target by mining the data. Because of its advantages of short time and low cost, it has received more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting druggable proteins. Firstly, the features of the protein sequence are extracted by combining Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), dipeptide composition (DPC) and reduced sequence (RS), getting the 591 dimension of drug target dataset","addition_date":"2019-11-14T20:05:35Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-09T13:33:12Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Bagging-SVM","home":"https://bio.tools/Bagging-SVM","summary":"> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'genetic algorithm Bagging-SVM', 'druggable', '93.78' | Accurate prediction of potential druggable proteins based on genetic algorithm and Bagging-SVM ensemble classifier | Discovering and accurately locating drug targets is of great significance for the research and development of new drugs.
