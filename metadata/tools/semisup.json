This reduces the multiple testing burden to one test per SNP, and allows for interactions with unobserved factors. Analysing one SNP at a time, it splits the individuals into two groups, based on the number of minor alleles.","addition_date":"2018-07-26T12:37:49Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
