From these specific k-mers, it also outputs their corresponding specific contigs which are sequences of consecutive k-mers (overlapping length between k-mers must be k-1, otherwise, it's a new contig). Kmerator first uses Jellyfish to create 2 requestable indexes from the reference genome and transcriptome, and second, decomposes your input transcript or gene sequences to count the occurences of each k-mer in the genome and transcriptome.","addition_date":"2021-10-04T10:07:48.031293Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T16:01:46.602609Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["0.5.2"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Kmerator","home":"https://bio.tools/kmerator","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"0.5.2","summary":"Kmerator is a prototype tool designed for the prediction of specific k-mers (also called tags) from input sequences, considering a reference genome and an ENSEMBL-like transcriptome.
