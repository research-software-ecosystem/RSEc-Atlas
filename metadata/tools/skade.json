In addition, understanding the molecular determinants of the solubility of proteins may be crucial to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of diseases caused by aggregation processes such as amyloidosis. Here we present SKADE, a novel Neural Network protein solubility predictor and we show how it can provide novel insight into the protein solubility mechanisms, thanks to its neural attention architecture. First, we show that SKADE positively compares with state of the art tools while using just the protein sequence as input. Then, thanks to the neural attention mechanism, we use SKADE to investigate the patterns learned during training and we analyse its decision process","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:18:34Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T15:21:07Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SKADE","home":"https://bio.tools/skade","summary":"Insight into the protein solubility driving forces with neural attention.\n\nProtein solubility is a key aspect for many biotechnological, biomedical and industrial processes, such as the production of active proteins and antibodies.
