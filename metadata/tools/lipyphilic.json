LiPyphilic is a set of tools for analysing MD simulations of lipid bilayers. It is an object-oriented Python package built directly on top of MDAnalysis, and makes use of NumPy and SciPy for efficient computation. The analysis classes are designed with the same interface as those of MDAnalysis - so if you know how to use analysis modules in MDAnalysis then learning lipyphilic will be a breeze","addition_date":"2021-10-04T12:07:20.247815Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-04T12:07:20.250224Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LiPyphilic","home":"https://bio.tools/lipyphilic","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"LiPyphilic is a Python toolkit for the analysis of lipid membrane simulations.
