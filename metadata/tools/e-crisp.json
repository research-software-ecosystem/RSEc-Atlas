The web application uses fast algorithms to identify target sequences for use with mediated genome editing. E-CRISP analyzes target specificity of the putative designs and assesses their genomic context (e.g. exons, transcripts, CpG islands). The design process incorporates different parameters of how CRISPR constructs can be used in experimental applications, such as knock-out and tagging experiments. E-CRISP can design guide RNAs for genomes of more than 30 organisms.","addition_date":"2018-11-08T14:49:53Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-10T04:56:00Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["5.3.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"E-CRISP","home":"https://bio.tools/e-crisp","version":"5.3.0","summary":"E-CRISP is a computational tool to design and evaluate guide RNAs for use with CRISPR/Cas9.
