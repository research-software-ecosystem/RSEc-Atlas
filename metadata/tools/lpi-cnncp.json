Then, the high-order one-hot encoding way is used to transform the protein/RNA sequences into image-like inputs of non-independent for capturing the dependencies among amino acids (or nucleotides). In the end, these encoded protein/RNA sequences are feed into a convolutional neural network to predict the lncRNA-protein interactions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:06:46Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T07:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LPI-CNNCP","home":"https://bio.tools/lpi-cnncp","summary":"Prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions by using convolutional neural network with the copy-padding trick.\n\nLPI-CNNCP designs a copy-padding trick to turn the protein/RNA sequences with variable-length into the fixed-length sequences, letting them meet the input requirements of CNN model.
