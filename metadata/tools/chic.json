The framework allows assessing quality of samples with sharp or broad enrichment profiles, whereas previously proposed metrics were not taking this into account. It provides a reference compendium of quality control metrics and trained machine learning models for scoring samples.","addition_date":"2018-07-06T14:28:49Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
