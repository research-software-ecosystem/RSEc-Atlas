Our tool will allow conservationists to prioritize conservation efforts and to focus limited resources on relevant species and regions. We showcase our tool with data on 258 bird species and various biophysical regions, including Environmental Zones in 58 Asian countries and regions. Our tool provides a decision support system for conservation policy with attractive and easily interpretable visual outputs illustrating national responsibilities and priorities for species conservation. The graphical output allows for smooth integration into assessment reports, such as the European Article 17 report, the Living Planet Index report, or similar regional and global reports.","addition_date":"2023-04-05T14:32:28.012049Z","last_update_date":"2023-04-05T15:19:59.004906Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"NRA-Tool","home":"https://bio.tools/nra-tool","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"The ArcGIS National Responsibility Assessment Tool (NRA-Tool) can be used to create hierarchical lists of national responsibilities and priorities for global species conservation.
