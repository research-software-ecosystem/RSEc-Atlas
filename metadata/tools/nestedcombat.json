{"tool_name":"nestedcombat","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"nestedcombat","home":"https://github.com/BenitoFar/NestedComBat","license":"MIT","summary":"This software performs feature-level harmonization of radiomic data extracted from medical images. Its primary goal is to reduce variability introduced by differences in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and imaging centers. The tool is based on the ComBat methodology, which uses an empirical Bayes linear model to correct batch effects by estimating location and scale parameters. It offers two harmonization strategies: the ComBat method, which aligns radiomic features to a common scale based on either all centers (ComBat) or a user-defined batch grouping (M-ComBat), and the Nested ComBat method, which enables simultaneous correction for multiple batch effects in hierarchical settings. This tool is intended to improve the robustness and comparability of radiomic features in multi-center studies.","addition_date":"2025-05-27T14:49:33.133482Z","last_update_date":"2025-05-29T08:28:15.553602Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["v1"],"collections":["EUCAIM"]}}}
