In CoDiFold, contacts and distance profiles are organically combined into the Rosetta low-resolution energy function to improve the accuracy of energy function. As a result, the correlation between energy and root mean square deviation (RMSD) is improved.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:38:59Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-14T16:24:03Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"CoDiFold","home":"https://bio.tools/codifold","summary":"CoDiFold is a de novo protein structure prediction by coupling contact with distance profile.
