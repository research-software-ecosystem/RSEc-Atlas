And this work is the first application of GCN on multi-stage malaria parasites recognition in blood smear images. The proposed DTGCN model is based on unsupervised learning by transferring knowledge learnt from source images that contain the discriminative morphology character-istics of multi-stage malaria parasites. These transferred information guarantees the effectiveness on the target parasites recognition.","addition_date":"2021-02-28T05:48:18Z","last_update_date":"2022-12-01T18:58:33.475821Z"}}}
