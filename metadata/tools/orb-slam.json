Our method extends the ORB-SLAM2 framework with the enhanced unified camera model (EUCM) as a projection function, which can be applied to catadioptric systems and wide-angle fisheye cameras. Without rectifying or cropping the input images, the proposed system can use the full area of the images even with strong distortion.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:08:48Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T14:21:52Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ORB-SLAM","home":"https://bio.tools/ORB-SLAM","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Accurate and Robust Monocular SLAM with Omnidirectional Cameras.\n\nA real-time robust monocular visual SLAM system based on ORB-SLAM for fisheye cameras, without rectifying or cropping the input images.\n\nWe develop an improved monocular visual SLAM system by using omnidirectional cameras.
