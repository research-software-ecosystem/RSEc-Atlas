The elucidation of a protein's interaction association network is important for defining its biological function. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches have emerged as powerful tools for identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-protein associations (PPAs). However, interactome association experiments are difficult to interpret, considering the complexity and abundance of data that are generated.
