It is based on a negative binomial noise model with dispersion trend smoothing by DESeq2 and uses the impulse model to constrain the mean expression trajectory of each gene.","addition_date":"2018-07-10T10:23:09Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
