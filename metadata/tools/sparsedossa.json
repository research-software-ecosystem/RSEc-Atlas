Provides a model based Bayesian method to characterize and simulate microbiome data. This model captures the marginal distribution of each microbial feature as a truncated, zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with parameters distributed as a parent log-normal distribution. The model can be effectively fit to reference microbial datasets in order to parameterize their microbes and communities, or to simulate synthetic datasets of similar population structure.","addition_date":"2018-07-26T17:12:53Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
