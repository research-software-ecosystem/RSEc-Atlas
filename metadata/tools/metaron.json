The pipeline predicts metagenomic operons without any any functional or experimental data. It comes with options to process the metagenomic data starting from filtered raw reads, which includes: assembly into scaffolds via IDBA, data manipulation, gene prediction via prodigal and lastly operon prediction based on gene's co-directionality, intergenic distance (IGD) and promoters.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:48:39Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-11T09:18:31Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MetaRon","home":"https://bio.tools/metaron","summary":"A pipeline for prediction of Metagenome and whole-genome opeRons.\n\nMetaRon (Metagenomic opeRon prediction pipeline) is a computational workflow for the prediction of operons from metagenomic data.
