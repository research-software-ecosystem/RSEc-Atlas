To perform spatially adaptive deraining, we propose a spatial density estimation (SDE) module to estimate a rain density map for each image. Since rain density varies across different color channels, we also propose a channel-wise (CW) deraining scheme.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:18:12Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-18T18:52:40Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CVID","home":"https://bio.tools/cvid-image","summary":"Conditional Variational Image Deraining (CVID) network for better deraining performance, leveraging the exclusive generative ability of Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) on providing diverse predictions for the rainy image.
