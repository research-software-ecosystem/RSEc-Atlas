Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a rapid, flexible, low-cost, and robust genotyping method that simultaneously discovers variants and calls genotypes within a broad range of samples. These characteristics make GBS an excellent tool for many applications and research questions from conservation biology to functional genomics in both model and non-model species. Continued improvement of GBS relies on a more comprehensive understanding of data analysis, development of fast and efficient bioinformatics pipelines, accurate missing data imputation, and active post-release support.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:25:29Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:39:39.982654Z","version":["2.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Fast-GBS","home":"https://bio.tools/fast-gbs","version":"2.0","summary":"Fast-GBS is an analysis toolkit for genotyping-by-sequencing data.
