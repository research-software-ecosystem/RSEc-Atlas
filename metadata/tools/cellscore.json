The evaluation is based upon a scoring system, which uses a set of standard samples of known cell types, as the reference set. The functions have been carried out on a large set of microarray data from one platform.","addition_date":"2018-07-06T14:05:12Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
