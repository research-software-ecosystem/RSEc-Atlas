By profiling 312,928 cells from 32 IPF, 29 healthy control and 18 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lungs, we demonstrate that IPF is characterized by changes in discrete subpopulations of cells in the three major parenchymal compartments: the epithelium, endothelium and stroma. Among epithelial cells, we identify a novel population of IPF enriched aberrant basaloid cells that co-express basal epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers, senescence markers, developmental transcription factors and are located at the edge of myofibroblast foci in the IPF lung","addition_date":"2019-11-14T20:04:35Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-14T13:07:36Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IPF","home":"https://bio.tools/IPF","summary":"Single Cell RNA-seq reveals ectopic and aberrant lung resident cell populations in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis | Abstract We provide a single cell atlas of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a fatal interstitial lung disease, focusing on resident lung cell populations.
