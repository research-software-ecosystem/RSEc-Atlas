The transcription factor (TF) binding score is computed in both the reference (hg19) and alternate human genome assemblies. The alternate genome assembly is generated by incorporating the alternate allele of common genetic variants (AF>=0.001) from the 1000 Genomes Project. Interesting candidate variants are those SNPs that disrupt, create or change the TF binding score/affinity between the two genomes.","addition_date":"2017-10-04T13:42:21Z","last_update_date":"2023-09-05T10:26:40.029325Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SNP2TFBS","home":"https://bio.tools/snp2tfbs","summary":"The resource is based on a new 'in silico' approach for identifying regulatory variants.
