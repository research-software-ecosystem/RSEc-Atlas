Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that the functions of RNA modifications are determined by the effectors that can catalyze, recognize and remove RNA modifications. They are called 'writers', 'readers' and 'erasers'. The identification of RNA modification effectors will be helpful for understanding the regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of RNA modifications. In this work, we developed a database called RNAWRE that specially deposits RNA modification effectors. The current version of RNAWRE stored 2045 manually curated writers, readers and erasers for the six major kinds of RNA modifications, namely Cap, m1A, m6A, m5C, \u03c8 and Poly A. The main modules of RNAWRE not only allow browsing and downloading the RNA modification effectors but also support the BLAST search of the potential RNA modification effectors in other species","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:52:46Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-07T12:50:42Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"RNAWRE","home":"https://bio.tools/rnawre","summary":"a resource of writers, readers and erasers of RNA modifications.\n\nRNA modifications are involved in various kinds of cellular biological processes.
