However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data.

This measure can assess pairwise differences between Hi-C matrices under a wide range of settings, and can be used to determine optimal sequencing depth.","addition_date":"2018-07-19T20:31:47Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:33:45.208568Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"hicrep","home":"https://bio.tools/hicrep","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.4.0","summary":"Hi-C is a powerful technology for studying genome-wide chromatin interactions.
