The main purpose of the tool is to compute chokepoints by taking into account both the topology and the dynamic information of the network. In addition to the computation of chokepoints, findCPcli can compute and remove dead-end metabolites, find essential reactions and update the flux bounds of the reactions according to the results of Flux Variability Analysis.\n\nfindCPcli takes as input an SBML files of genome-scale models, and provides as output a spreadsheet file with the results of the chokepoint computation.","addition_date":"2022-01-18T00:43:17.615389Z","last_update_date":"2022-01-18T00:43:17.618060Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["COVID-19"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ifindCPcli","home":"https://bio.tools/ifindcpcli","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"findCPcli is a command line python-tool for the computation of chokepoint reactions in genome-scale metabolic models.
