A nucleosome consists of 145-147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.7 times around eight histones. Given a four-letter code (A, C, G, T), there are approximately 4147 or 1088 oligonucleotides that can form a nucleosome. Comparative, rather than comprehensive, studies are required. Here we introduce the TMB Library of nucleosome simulations and present a meta-analysis of over 20 \u03bcs of all atom molecular dynamics simulations representing 518 different realizations of the nucleosome. The TMB Library serves as a reference for future comparative, on-demand simulations of nucleosomes and a demonstration of iBIOMES Lite as a tool for managing a laboratory's simulation library","addition_date":"2019-11-14T20:03:46Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-28T16:20:05Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TMB","home":"https://bio.tools/TMB","summary":"> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'iBIOMES', 'Lite', 'iBIOMES Lite', 'nucleosome' | TMB Library of Nucleosome Simulations | Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of chromatin, the biomaterial that houses the genome in all higher organisms.
