In particular, it correlates the genome wide mRNA log fold changes in experiments involving the knockout/knockdown/overexpression of one or more miRNAs with the motif content of the 3'UTRs. The model is based on linear regression, and is intended for genome-wide studies.","addition_date":"2017-01-24T11:55:12Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:39Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"miReduce","home":"https://bio.tools/mireduce","summary":"This tool correlates the logarithm of expression fold changes of a set of genes with the motif content of the regulatory sequences of these genes.
