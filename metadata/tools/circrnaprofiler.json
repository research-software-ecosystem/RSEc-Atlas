This computational framework allows to combine and analyze circRNAs previously detected by multiple publicly available annotation-based circRNA detection tools. It covers different aspects of circRNAs analysis from differential expression analysis, evolutionary conservation, biogenesis to functional analysis. The pipeline used by circRNAprofiler is highly automated and customizable. Furthermore, circRNAprofiler includes additional functions for data visualization which facilitate the interpretation of the results.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:16:21Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T19:17:53Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"circRNAprofiler","home":"https://bio.tools/circrnaprofiler","summary":"circRNAprofiler is an R-based framework that only requires an R installation and offers 15 modules for a comprehensive in silico analysis of circRNAs.
