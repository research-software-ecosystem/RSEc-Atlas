For multiple integrated perturbation screens a hierarchical model that considers the variance between different biological conditions is fitted. The resulting list of gene effects is then further extended using a network propagation algorithm to correct for false negatives.","addition_date":"2018-07-25T08:43:38Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
