After which, other macros will extract the haplotype information, calculate linkage disequilibrium between markers, and prepare an input sheet for the \u201cGOLD\u201d program.\u00a0Then, a last macro can reconstruct the haplotypes of each individual in the population,using a maximum likelihood method and the haplotypes present in the population as proposed by Arlequin.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:07:35Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.0"]}}}
