BSBolt is an integrated analysis platform that offers support for bisulfite sequencing read simulation, alignment, methylation calling, data aggregation, and data imputation. BSBolt has been validated to work with a wide array of bisulfite sequencing data,including whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representative bisulfite sequencing data (RRBS), and targeted methylation sequencing data. BSBolt utilizes forked versions of BWA and WGSIM for read alignment and read simulation respectively.
