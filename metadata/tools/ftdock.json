In order to scan rotational space it is necessary to rediscretise one of the molecules (for speed the smaller) for each rotation. The scoring method is primarily a surface complementarity score between the two grids. To speed up the surface complementarity calculations, which are convolutions of two grids, Fourier Transforms are used.","addition_date":"2018-03-07T15:00:33Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:52Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
