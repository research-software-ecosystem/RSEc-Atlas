(DIMEDR) attempts to bridge the inconsistencies between incongruent LC-MS metabolomics datasets of the same biological sample type. A single \u201cprimary\u201d dataset is postprocessed via traditional means of peak identification, alignment, and grouping. DIMEDR utilizes this primary dataset as a progenitor template by which data from subsequent disparate datasets are reassembled and integrated into a unified framework that maximizes spectral feature similarity across all samples. This is accomplished by a novel procedure for universal retention time correction and comparison via identification of ubiquitous features in the initial primary dataset, which are subsequently utilized as endogenous internal standards during integration.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:17:14Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:41:07.302723Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"DIMEDR","home":"https://bio.tools/dimedr","summary":"DIMEDR (Disparate Metabolomics Data Reassembler) is a algorithm for agglomerating incongruent LC-MS metabolomics datasets.
