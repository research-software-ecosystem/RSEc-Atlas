It generalizes well to new species and is robust to limitations in training data size. Its design reflects the intuition that for two proteins to physically interact, a subset of amino acids from each protein should be in con-tact with the other. The intermediate stages of D-SCRIPT directly implement this intuition, with the penultimate stage in D-SCRIPT being a rough estimate of the inter-protein contact map of the protein dimer. This structurally-motivated design enhances the interpretability of the results and, since structure is more conserved evolutionarily than sequence, improves generalizability across species.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:36:17Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:45:29.768553Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"D-SCRIPT","home":"https://bio.tools/d-script","license":"MIT","summary":"D-SCRIPT is a deep learning method for predicting a physical interaction between two proteins given just their sequences.
