Phase I and or I II oncology trials are conducted to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and or optimal biological dose (OBD) of a new drug or treatment. In these trials, for cytotoxic agents, the primary aim of the single-agent or drug-combination is to find the MTD with a certain target toxicity rate, while for the cytostatic agents, a more appropriate target is the OBD, which is often defined by consideration of toxicity and efficacy simultaneously.
