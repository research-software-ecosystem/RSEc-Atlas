Even in datasets with less clear biological distinctions, stable subgroups with different expression profiles and clinical associations were found.","addition_date":"2024-06-14T03:30:10.287404Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T13:55:19.421001Z","tool_type":["Script"],"version":["1.6.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Omada","home":"https://bio.tools/omada","version":"1.6.0","summary":"We have developed a suite of tools to automate RNAseq clustering processes and make robust unsupervised clustering of transcriptomic data more accessible through automated machine learning based functions.
