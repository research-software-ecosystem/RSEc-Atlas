However, a robust, open-source, and spatially explicit ABM coding platform is currently lacking. We present abmR, an R package for conducting continental-scale ABM simulations across animal taxa. The package features two movement functions, each of which relies on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model. The theoretical background for abmR is discussed and the main functionalities are illustrated using two example populations.
