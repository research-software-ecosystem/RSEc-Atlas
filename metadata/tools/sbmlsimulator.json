For simulation it contains the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library, which has been benchmarked against the entire SBML Test Suite and all models from the Biomodels.net database. It includes a large collection of nature-inspired heuristic optimization procedures for efficient model calibration. SBMLsimulator provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and several command-line options to be suitable for large-scale batch processing and model calibration. SBMLsimulator runs on all platforms that provide a standard Java Virtual Machine and is based on the open-source library JSBML.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:03:03Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T16:43:19Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SBMLsimulator","home":"https://bio.tools/sbmlsimulator","summary":"A Java Tool for Model Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Systems Biology.\n\nSBMLsimulator is a fast, accurate, and easily usable program for dynamic model simulation and heuristic parameter optimization of models encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
