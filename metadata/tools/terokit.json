There is a growing concern about terpenome by the Pharmaceutical Chemist because of their huge medicinal value, with artemisinin and paclitaxel for representative. By utilizing the tenet of enzyme catalysis in all living organisms, all the natural terpenome are derived from the two essential C5 isoprene units, IPP and DAMPP (see left figures). TeroKit is a webserver-based multi-scale kit conducive to the research of terpenome. It contains a database with annotated data of more than 120,000 terpenome compounds. TeroKit provides the online retrieval and analysis of chemical space, target identification and biosynthetic pathway (under construction) for terpenome.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:39:24Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-27T08:53:33Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TeroKit","home":"https://bio.tools/terokit","summary":"A Database-Driven Web Server for Terpenome Research.\n\n\nTerpenome defines as all terpenoid-like and terpenoid-derived compounds, including the terpenoids, steroids and their derivatives.
