It does not make any assumptions on the composition of the data, such as the number of samples, heterogeneity or polyploidy. Taking paired ends mapped to a reference genome as input, it merges mappings to clusters based on a similarity score that takes both the putative location and size of an indel into account.","addition_date":"2016-01-20T09:50:50Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:40:27.566187Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1"],"collections":["BiGi","de.NBI"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"AggloIndel","home":"https://bio.tools/aggloindel","version":"1","summary":"This tool to detect structural variations is specifically designed to cluster short-read paired-end data into possibly overlapping predictions for deletions and insertions.
