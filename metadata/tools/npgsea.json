These approaches are computationally expensive and have minimum achievable p-values based on the number of permutations, not on the actual observed statistics. We have derived three parametric approximations to the permutation distributions of two gene set enrichment test statistics. We can reduce the computational burden and granularity issues of permutation testing with our method, which is implemented in this package.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:03:42Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-11T00:41:16Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.10.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"npGSEA","home":"https://bio.tools/npgsea","license":"Artistic-2.0","version":"1.10.0","summary":"Current gene set enrichment methods rely upon permutations for inference.
