In particular, given a table with sample information and a design formula, ExploreModelMatrix illustrates the fitted values from a general linear model (or, more generally, the value of the linear predictor of a generalized linear model) for each combination of input variables, simplifying understanding and generation of contrasts. A number of other visualizations are also included in the interactive interface, particularly simplifying the interpretation of linear models.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:07:05Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T10:36:17Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ExploreModelMatrix","home":"https://bio.tools/exploremodelmatrix","license":"MIT","summary":"ExploreModelMatrix is a small R package that lets the user interactively explore a design matrix as generated by the model.matrix() R function.
