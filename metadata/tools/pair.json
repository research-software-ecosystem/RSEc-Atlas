It predicts interactions by a fine-tuned support vector machine model that integrates indirect evidences for interaction, such as gene co-expressions, domain interactions, shared GO annotations, co-localizations, phylogenetic profile similarities and homologous interactions in other organisms. It features a user-friendly query interface, providing rich annotation on the relationships between two proteins.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T12:32:44Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:54Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
