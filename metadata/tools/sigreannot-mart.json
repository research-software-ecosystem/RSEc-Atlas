The tool is a query environment populated with regularly updated annotations for different oligo sets. It permits easy extraction in different formats using filters. It is used to compare probe sets on different criteria, to choose the set for a given experiment to mix probe sets in order to create a new one.","addition_date":"2017-04-22T17:35:27Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:51Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
