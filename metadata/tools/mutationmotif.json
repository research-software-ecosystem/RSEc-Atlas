Two different analysis approaches are supported: (1) log-linear analysis of neighbourhood base influences on mutation coupled with a sequence logo like representation of influences; (2) log-linear analysis of mutation spectra, the relative proportions of different mutation directioons from a starting base. A logo-like visualisation of the latter is also supported.","addition_date":"2016-10-19T03:41:04Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:53Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MutationMotif","home":"https://bio.tools/mutationmotif","version":"1","summary":"This library provides capabilities for analysis of mutation properties.
