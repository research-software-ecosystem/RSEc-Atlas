Therefore, we developed the LABiocin database, a specialized database on LAB bacteriocins. The database was stored and compiled using MySQL with NetBeans IDE as the platform. Important data are compiled, including bacteriocin name, class, amino acids and nucleic acid sequences, if available. Target microorganisms, origin, status of the producing strains and their culture conditions and extraction and purification methods are also included in this new database. A phylogenetic tree for the mature peptide bacteriocin sequences has also been created","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:16:51Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-14T14:32:23Z","tool_type":["Database portal","Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LABiocin database","home":"https://bio.tools/LABiocin_database","summary":"A new database designed specifically for Lactic Acid Bacteria bacteriocins | Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are successfully applied as natural alternatives to food preservation and to antibiotics; however, information on these antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is scattered through the literature and databases.
