Flexible ligand docking is possible with ArgusLab, where the ligand is described as a torsion tree and grids are constructed that overlay the binding site. Ligand\u2019s root node is placed on a search point in the binding site and a set of diverse and energetically favorable rotations is created.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:40Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["4.0.1"]}}}
