Using grid graphics, plotgardener empowers users to programmatically and flexibly generate multi-panel figures. plotgardener accomplishes these goals by utilizing 1) a coordinate-based plotting system, and 2) edge-to-edge containerized data visualization. The coordinate-based plotting system grants users precise control over the size, position, and arrangement of plots. Its edge-to-edge plotting functions preserve the mapping between user-specified containers and the represented data. This allows users to stack plots with confidence that vertically aligned data will correspond to the same regions.","addition_date":"2022-02-08T17:03:49.897699Z","last_update_date":"2022-02-08T17:03:49.900388Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"plotgardener","home":"https://bio.tools/plotgardener","license":"Other","summary":"plotgardener is a genomic data visualization package for R.
