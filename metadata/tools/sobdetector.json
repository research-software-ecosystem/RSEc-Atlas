Although it was created for human somatic mutation filtration, it can be used on samples of any species and in a germline variant calling analysiss as well.","addition_date":"2021-12-06T11:12:48.867536Z","last_update_date":"2021-12-06T11:12:48.870123Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SOBDetector","home":"https://bio.tools/sobdetector","license":"MIT","summary":"Strand Orientation Bias Detector (SOBDetector) is a tool that reanalyzes the mutations stored in a VCF (by any mutation caller), and evaluates whether the reads which support the alternate alleles have a strand orientation bias using the original binary alignment (BAM) files.
