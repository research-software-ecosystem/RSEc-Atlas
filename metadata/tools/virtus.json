VIRTUS is the first tool to detect viral transcripts considering their splicing event rather than the viral genome copy number. VIRTUS can be applied to both bulk RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq. The virus reference covers 762 viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (cause of COVID-19). The workflow is implemented by Common Workflow Language and Rabix. You can specify each parameter individually or give yaml or json file which describes all the parameter information.
