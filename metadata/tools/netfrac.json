Some of these measures are based on the shortest path concept, namely Spp, Spep, Spelp and Spinp distances and the Transfer index, and a few others are adapted from existing concepts in the literature (UniFrac, Motifs). The networks are Igraph objects consisting of nodes and edges.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:10:36Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T13:37:56Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"NetFrac","home":"https://bio.tools/netfrac","summary":"Transfer index, NetUniFrac and some useful shortest path-based distances for community analysis in sequence similarity networks.\n\nThe R package NetFrac is used to calculate various distances and indices between species communities in sequence similarity sequence (SSN).
