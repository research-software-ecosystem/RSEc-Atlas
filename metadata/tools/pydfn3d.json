A new Boundary Element Method (BEM) technique with discontinuous quadratic elements and a parallel Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) is presented herein for the simulation of the steady-state fluid flow in 3D DFN systems with wellbores, consisting of planar fractures having arbitrary properties and wellbore trajectories. Numerical examples characterized by DFNs of increasing complexity are investigated to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented technique.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:39:22Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-13T18:16:38Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PyDFN3D","home":"https://bio.tools/PyDFN3D","summary":"Discontinuous Boundary Elements for Fluid Flow Problems in Discrete Fracture Networks.\n\nModeling fluid flow in three-dimensional (3D) Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) is of relevance in many engineering applications, such as hydraulic fracturing, oil gas production, geothermal energy extraction, nuclear waste disposal and CO2 sequestration.
