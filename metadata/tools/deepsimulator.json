Starting from a given reference genome or assembled contigs, we simulate the electrical current signals by a context-dependent deep learning model, followed by a base-calling procedure to yield simulated reads. This workflow mimics the sequencing procedure more naturally.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:03:52Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-27T15:13:31Z","version":["1.5"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DeepSimulator","home":"https://bio.tools/deepsimulator","version":"1.5","summary":"DeepSimulator is a deep learning based simulator to mimic the entire pipeline of Nanopore sequencing.
