Statistical interactive charts, readsets location maps and tables, and the resulting list of datasets are associated with the search functions. For each selected dataset, the user can access readset and assembly short summary pages with cross-references to external databases (EBI SRA, NCBI taxID, WORMS), which allow better traceability and homogeneity across databases, as well as the possibility of downloading all resulting files...The intention is to develop the database continually as the transcriptomes of new species are sequenced and thus provide an up-to-date reference dedicated to the diversity of euphausiids.","addition_date":"2023-03-01T10:47:21.937523Z","last_update_date":"2023-03-01T11:40:02.870378Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
