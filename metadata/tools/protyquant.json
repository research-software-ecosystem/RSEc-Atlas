ProtyQuant performs protein inference and quantification calculations and combines the results of individual datasets into plain text tables. These are lightweight, human-readable, and easy to import into databases or statistical software. ProtyQuant reads validated pepXML from proteomic workflows such as the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), which makes it compatible with many commercial and free search engines. For protein inference and quantification, a modified version of the PIPQ program (He et al. 2016) was integrated. In contrast to simple spectral-counting, PIPQ sums up peptide probabilities","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:27:25Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-29T17:42:44Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"ProtyQuant","home":"https://bio.tools/protyquant","summary":"Comparing Label-Free Shotgun Proteomics Datasets Using Accumulated Peptide Probabilities.\n\nComparing multiple label-free shotgun proteomics datasets requires various data processing and formatting steps, including peptide-spectrum matching, protein inference, and quantification.
