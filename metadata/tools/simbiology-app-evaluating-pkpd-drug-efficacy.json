The SimBiology\u00ae model that is included is based on a tumor growth model developed by Koch, Walz, Lahu, and Schropp. Users can use the app as an example interface for entering an initial tumor weight, cell line, and dosing schedule, in order to simulate tumor growth inhibition in response to different drug therapies and generate a report. Using MATLAB Compiler\u00ae, the SimBiology\u00ae model can be deployed as part of a standalone MATLAB\u00ae app for distribution to other users.","addition_date":"2021-05-05T10:53:47Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-14T12:53:41Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.2.0.1"],"collections":["File Exchange","MATLAB"]}}}
