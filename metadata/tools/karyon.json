Karyon is a pipeline for the assembly and analysis of highly heterozygous genomes. It uses redundans (Pryszcz & Gabald\u00f3n, 2016) to reduce heterozygosity during the assembly process, and then maps the original libraries against the reduced assembly to analyze the distribution of heterozygous regions. With this information, it generates a series of plots that can aid researchers to generate informed hypotheses with regard of the architecture of their genomes.","addition_date":"2021-10-04T09:21:44.724348Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:55:28.021365Z","tool_type":["Workbench","Workflow"],"version":["1.2"],"collections":["IMPaCT-Data"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Karyon","home":"https://bio.tools/karyon","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"1.2","summary":"Karyon is a computational framework for the diagnosis of hybrids, aneuploids, and other non-standard architectures in genome assemblies.
