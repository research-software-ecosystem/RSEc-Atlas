It helps users run experiments using many state-of-the-art deep learning methods and addresses the challenge of selecting model parameters in deep learning models using a fully automatic model selection strategy. This helps avoid hand-tuning and thus removes any bias in running experiments, making it user friendly without losing its flexibility. While it was designed with ChIP-seq and CLIP-seq data in mind, it can be used for any DNA/RNA sequence binary classification problem","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:44:12Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-20T11:27:26Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"deepRAM","home":"https://bio.tools/deepRAM","summary":"Comprehensive evaluation of deep learning architectures for prediction of DNA/RNA sequence binding specificities | End-to-end deep learning toolkit for predicting protein binding sites and motifs | deepRAM is an end-to-end deep learning toolkit for predicting protein binding sites and motifs.
