It is composed by two software layers: a Library for Symbolic Calculus (LSC) and a Command Line Interface (CLI), implementing a symbolic calculus operating on SN arc expressions. The CLI is a parser of expressions denoting structural relationships in SN models, it reads from the standard input, thus it can be used as a user interface or can be integrated in other tools for the design of SN models.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:12:49Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:42:28.978309Z"}}}
