{"tool_name":"alphabet","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"alphabet","home":"http://motif.stanford.edu/distributions/alphabet/index.html","summary":"Alphabet takes a database of aligned protein sequences in BLOCKS+ format and examines the alignments column-wise looking for groups of amino acids that co-occur in columns more frequently than expected based on overall amino acid composition. These groups of amino acids can form a reduced alphabet for building sequence motifs (eMOTIFs) or for detecting correlations between columns of amino acids (MCSeq).","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:33Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-11T19:06:59Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
