The library includes parameters and functions to control mutation rates, linkage disequilibrium strength and block lengths, and number of individuals. To generate genomic data, the HaploDX framework offers a pipeline of functions that can be used to simulate: (1) the allele frequency spectra of different populations; (2) the Hardy-Weinberg principle for genotypes and haplotypes; (3) linkage disequilibrium across different populations.","addition_date":"2023-08-10T06:34:50.688270Z","last_update_date":"2023-08-10T06:58:47.053221Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["0.2-beta.4"]}}}
