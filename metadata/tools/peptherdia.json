Manually curated database containing a searchable list of approved peptide drugs and diagnostic agents. On these compounds, we have performed a detailed analysis of the structural features and collected information on their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, indication, route of administration, production methodologies, marketing authorisation and origin of their design. The final purpose of this database is to aid the scientific community to more successfully design or pre-screen candidates at an early stage of the peptide drug discovery process.","addition_date":"2021-11-01T13:07:12.512309Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-01T13:07:12.515032Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PepTherDia","home":"https://bio.tools/peptherdia","summary":"PepTherDia is a database and tool for structural composition analysis of approved peptide therapeutics and diagnostics.
