Matrix eQTL can test for association between genotype and gene expression using linear regression with either additive or ANOVA genotype effects. The models can include covariates to account for factors as population stratification, gender, and clinical variables. It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors, false discovery rate estimation and separate treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs."}}}
