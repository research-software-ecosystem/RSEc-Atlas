It can also be used for finding gene expression variations associated with other grouping factors like cell lineages. Following is the detail information and usage of this program.

R Packages is a book based around this workflow.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:00:32Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T17:46:07Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SCeQTL","home":"https://bio.tools/sceqtl","summary":"an R package for identifying eQTL from single-cell parallel sequencing data.\n\nSCeQTL is an R package that uses zero-inflated negative binomial regression to do eQTL analysis on single-cell data.
