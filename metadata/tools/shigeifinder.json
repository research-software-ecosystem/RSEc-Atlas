Cluster-specific gene markers enhance Shigella and Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli in silico serotyping.\n\nThis is a tool that is used to identify differentiate Shigella/EIEC using cluster-specific genes and identify the serotype using O-antigen/H-antigen genes. This pipeline can serotype over 59 Shigella and 22 EIEC serotypes using either assembled whole genomes or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) reads. The results are output in a tabular format which if saved as a file can be opened in Excel or other tabular programs. Also available as an online tool.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:59:54Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-09T09:15:27Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ShigEiFinder","home":"https://bio.tools/shigeifinder","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Shigella EIEC Cluster Enhanced Serotyper Finder.
