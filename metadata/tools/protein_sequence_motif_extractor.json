Results are stored in a new file containing the regions of the protein that contain the specified motif. The default output format is a new fasta file named _Motifs.fasta, but you can alternatively use /T to specify that a tab-delimited text file be created.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:11:23Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0.4752"]}}}
