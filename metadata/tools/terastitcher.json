The produced images can be saved into a multiresolution representation to be efficiently retrieved and processed.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:13:45Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:37:17.488096Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.9.2"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TeraStitcher","home":"https://bio.tools/terastitcher","version":"1.9.2","summary":"TeraStitcher is a free tool that enables the stitching of Teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images even on workstations with relatively limited resources of memory (< 8 GB) and processing power.
