A key challenge in interpreting cancer genomes is to distinguish drivers of cancer development among available genetic mutations. To address this issue, we present the first web-based application, consensus cancer driver gene caller (C3), to identify the consensus driver genes using six different complementary strategies, i.e., frequency-based, machine learning-based, functional bias-based, clustering-based, statistics model-based, and network-based strategies. This application allows users to specify customized operations when calling driver genes, and provides solid statistical evaluations and interpretable visualizations on the integration results","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:39:55Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-09T16:30:00Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Consensus Cancer driver gene Caller (C3)","home":"https://bio.tools/C3","summary":"Consensus Cancer Driver Gene Caller | Next-generation sequencing has allowed identification of millions of somatic mutations in human cancer cells.
