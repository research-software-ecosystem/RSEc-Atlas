To analyze human motion with micro-Doppler signatures measured by radar, a deep learning algorithm is one of the most effective approaches. Because deep learning requires a large data set, the high cost involved in measuring large amounts of human data is an intrinsic problem. The objective of this study is to augment human motion micro-Doppler data employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve the accuracy of human motion classification. Methods:To test data augmentation provided by GANs, authentic data for 7 human activities were collected using micro-Doppler radar.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:42:41Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-25T13:49:44Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"e-hir GAN","home":"https://bio.tools/e-hir-gan","license":"MIT","summary":"Augmentation of Doppler Radar Data Using Generative Adversarial Network for Human Motion Analysis.\n\nObjectives:Human motion analysis can be applied to the diagnosis of musculoskeletal diseases, rehabilitation therapies, fall detection, and estimation of energy expenditure.
