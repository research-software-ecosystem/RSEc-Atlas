The method uses genome-wide summary statistics from two diseases or ancestries to improve the genetic effect estimate and standard error at SNPs where there is homogeneity of effect between the two datasets. When there is significant evidence of heterogeneity, the genetic effect from the disease or population closest to the target population is maintained.","addition_date":"2024-06-18T15:49:47.644440Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T13:53:30.693370Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"shaPRS","home":"https://bio.tools/shaprs","summary":"Novel method that leverages widespread pleiotropy between traits, or shared genetic effects across ancestries, to improve the accuracy of polygenic scores.
