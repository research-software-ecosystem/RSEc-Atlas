In this study, we propose iProDNA-CapsNet -- a new prediction model identifying protein-DNA binding residues using an ensemble of Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) on position specific scoring matrix (PSMM) profiles. The use of CapsNets promises an innovative approach to determine the location of DNA-binding residues. In this study, the benchmark datasets introduced by Hu et al.
