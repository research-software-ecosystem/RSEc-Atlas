It will generate distributions for any number of genes and use those distributions to generate intensities for any number of replicates. It generates two-class data and any number of the genes can be chosen to be differentially expressed. The program is very flexible and the parameters of the differentially expressed genes can be set by the user.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:06:59Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
