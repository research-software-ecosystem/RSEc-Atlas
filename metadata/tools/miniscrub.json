Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. The limited sensitivity of existing read-based error correction methods can cause large-scale mis-assemblies in the assembled genomes, motivating further innovation in this area. RESULTS:Here we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method, called MiniScrub, for identification and subsequent \"scrubbing\" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments to minimize their interference in downstream assembly process. MiniScrub first generates read-to-read overlaps via MiniMap2, then encodes the overlaps into images, and finally builds CNN models to predict low-quality segments","addition_date":"2020-01-14T08:56:32Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-29T08:55:21Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MiniScrub","home":"https://bio.tools/MiniScrub","summary":"De novo Nanopore read quality improvement using deep learning.\n\nBACKGROUND:Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification.
