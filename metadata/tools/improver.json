Our new computational pipeline, the Integral Membrane Protein Stability Selector (IMPROvER) provides a rational approach to variant selection by employing three independent approaches: deep-sequence, model-based and data-driven. In silico tests using known stability data, and in vitro tests using three membrane protein targets with 7, 11 and 16 transmembrane helices provided measures of success. In vitro, individual approaches alone all identified stabilising variants at a rate better than expected by random selection. Low numbers of overlapping predictions between approaches meant a greater success rate was achieved (fourfold better than random) when approaches were combined and selections restricted to the highest ranked sites","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:45:53Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-18T09:28:06Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IMPROvER","home":"https://bio.tools/improver","summary":"The Integral Membrane Protein Stability Selector.\n\nIdentifying stabilising variants of membrane protein targets is often required for structure determination.
