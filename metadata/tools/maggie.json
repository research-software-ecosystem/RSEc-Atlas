By leveraging measurements and genetic variation information from different genotypes (human individuals, animal strains, or alleles), MAGGIE associates the mutation of DNA sequence motif with various types of epigenomic features, including but not limited to transcription factor binding, open chromatin, histone modification, and stimulus response of regulatory elements.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:31:04Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T08:50:01Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MAGGIE","home":"https://bio.tools/maggie","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Leveraging genetic variation to identify DNA sequence motifs mediating transcription factor binding and function.\n\nMAGGIE provides a framework for identifying DNA sequence motifs mediating transcription factor binding and function.
