Despite their tight coupling, existing model quality estimation methods do not leverage inter-residue distance information or the latest technological breakthrough in deep learning that has recently revolutionized protein structure prediction. Results We present a new distance-based single-model quality estimation method called QDeep by harnessing the power of stacked deep residual neural networks (ResNets). Our method first employs stacked deep ResNets to perform residue-level ensemble error classifications at multiple predefined error thresholds and then combines the predictions from the individual error classifiers for estimating the quality of a protein structural model","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:32:34Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-31T11:55:33Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"QDeep","home":"https://bio.tools/qdeep","summary":"distance-based protein model quality estimation by residue-level ensemble error classifications using stacked deep residual neural networks.\n\nProtein model quality estimation, in many ways, informs protein structure prediction.
