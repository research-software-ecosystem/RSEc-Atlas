ICSF uses base-pair step parameters obtained from a collection of high-resolution DNA crystal structures to discover structural conservation that exists in the sequentially degenerate areas within a binding site and produce profiles of the structural features along the entire site.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:46:45Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:56Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
