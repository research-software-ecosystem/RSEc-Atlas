It first creates multiple threading alignments to recognize homologous and analogous template structures, from which a domain conservation score is then calculated for deducing the domain boundaries. Next, a boundary clustering method is used to optimize the domain model selections. For discontinuous domain structures, a symmetric alignment algorithm is applied to further integrate and refine the domain assignments.","addition_date":"2018-07-16T09:42:49Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ThreaDomEx","home":"https://bio.tools/threadom_ex","summary":"Takes the amino acid sequence of the query protein as input.
