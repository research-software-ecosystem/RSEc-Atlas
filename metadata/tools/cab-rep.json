The database has a total of 267.9 and 72.9 million curated full-length V(D)J heavy and light chain transcripts respectively, which were generated using illumina sequencing technology in previous studies. We removed redundancy and sequencing errors in the raw datasets, and annotated each transcript including gene origin, antibody isotype, mutations, post-translational modification, and other characteristics","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:33:19Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-19T20:40:29Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"cAb-Rep","home":"https://bio.tools/cAb-Rep","summary":"A Database of Curated Antibody Repertoires for Exploring antibody diversity and Predicting Antibody Prevalence | cAb-Rep is a database of curated antibody repertoires.
