{"tool_name":"metacv","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"metacv","home":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/metacv/","summary":"MetaCV is a composition and phylogeny based algorithm to classify very short metagenomic reads (75-100 bp) into specific taxonomic and functional groups. MetaCV performs (for both sensitivity and specificity) as good as BlastX-based methods on simulated short reads, but runs 300 times faster thus provides effectively and efficiently analysis on huge amount of NGS data.","addition_date":"2021-05-26T20:45:54Z","last_update_date":"2021-07-20T19:21:15Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
