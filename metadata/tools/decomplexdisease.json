Different from the established DEG analysis tools, it does not assume the patients of complex diseases to share the common DEGs. By applying a bi-clustering algorithm, DECD finds the DEGs shared by as many patients.","addition_date":"2018-07-08T11:18:47Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
