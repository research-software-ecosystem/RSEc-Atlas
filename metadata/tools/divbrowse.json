By seamlessly combining BLAST as an entry point together with interactive data analysis features such as principal component analysis in one graphical user interface, DivBrowse provides a novel and unique set of exploratory data analysis capabilities for genomic biodiversity datasets. The capability to integrate DivBrowse into existing web applications supports interoperability between different web applications. Built-in interactive computation of principal component analysis allows users to perform ad-hoc analysis of the population structure based on specific genetic elements such as genes and exons. Data interoperability is supported by the ability to export genomic diversity data in VCF and General Feature Format (GFF3) files.","addition_date":"2022-09-22T07:38:56.089490Z","last_update_date":"2022-09-22T11:56:21.702090Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Plug-in","Web application"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["de.NBI","denbi-gcbn"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DivBrowse","home":"https://bio.tools/divbrowse","license":"MIT","version":"1.0.0","summary":"DivBrowse is a web application for interactive visualization and exploratory analysis of genomic diversity data stored in Variant Call Format (VCF) files of any size.
