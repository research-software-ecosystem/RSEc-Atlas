Individuals of a cohort are clustered using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), latent feature dimensions are uncovered using different unsupervised methods including Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and correlations between -omics and phenotype dimensions are determined in downstream analyses including results visualisation.","addition_date":"2023-11-23T10:53:51.802150Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T13:51:05.297240Z","tool_type":["Workflow"],"version":["2.2","2.3"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"X-omics ACTION demonstrator multi-omics analysis workflow","home":"https://bio.tools/x-omics_action_demonstrator_multi-omics_analysis_workflow","license":"MIT","version":["2.3","2.2"],"summary":"This multi-omics data analysis workflow was developed as part of a case study investigating shared patterns between multi-omics data and childhood externalizing behaviour.
