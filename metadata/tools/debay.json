DEBay estimates cell type-specific gene expression by deconvolution of quantitative PCR data of a mixed population. It will be useful in experiments where the segregation of different cell types in a sample is arduous, but the proportion of different cell types in the sample can be measured. DEBay uses the population distribution data and the qPCR data to calculate the relative expression of the target gene in different cell types in the sample.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:30:44Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:42:03.258718Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DEBay","home":"https://bio.tools/debay","summary":"DEBay is a computational tool for deconvolution of quantitative PCR data for estimation of cell type-specifc gene expression in a mixed population.
