This algorithm measures the clustering of proteins with a shared Gene Ontology (GO) annotation within the provided PPI network weighted with quantitative proteomics data. The significance of this clustering measure is then estimated from a normal distribution approximated from a Monte Carlo Sampling Distribution. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we assess the false discovery rate at various thresholds against a null model.","addition_date":"2021-10-27T19:49:20.230464Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-27T19:49:20.233029Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PIGNON","home":"https://bio.tools/pignon","license":"Not licensed","summary":"PIGNON is a protein-protein interaction (PPI)-guided functional enrichment analysis for quantitative proteomics.
