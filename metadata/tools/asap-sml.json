The pipeline first extracts germline, CDR canonical structure, isoelectric point and frequent positional motifs features from sequences and creates an antibody feature fingerprint. Machine-learning and statistical significance testing are applied to antibody sequences and feature fingerprints to identify distinguishing feature values and combinations thereof. When applied to an MMP-targeting set, ASAP identifies salient features and recommends features to use when designing novel MPP-targeting antibody sequences.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:45:14Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-28T20:03:38Z","tool_type":["Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ASAP-SML","home":"https://bio.tools/asap-sml","license":"MIT","summary":"Antibody Sequence Analysis Pipeline Using Statistical Testing and Machine Learning (ASAP-SML) is a pipeline to identify distinguishing features in targeting antibody set when compared to a reference non-targeting set.
