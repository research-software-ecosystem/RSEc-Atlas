It is based on a mechanical duplex model parametrized by massive molecular dynamics simulations. It provides datasets with predicted parameters together with visualizations in interactive plots. It can include alternative sequences, such as epigenetically modified or radiation damaged.","addition_date":"2024-11-24T20:19:04.453765Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:19:04.456662Z"}}}
