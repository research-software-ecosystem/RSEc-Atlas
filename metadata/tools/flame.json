Flame is a web application, with a Python backend and a web-based graphic interface, which can be used as a desktop application or installed in a server receiving requests from multiple users.

The model building workflow can be customized from the graphic interface, selecting the type of normalization, molecular descriptors, and machine learning algorithm to be used from a panel of state-of-the-art methods implemented natively.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:00:57Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-03T13:20:35.856929Z","tool_type":["Web API","Web application","Workbench"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Flame","home":"https://bio.tools/flame","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Flame is an open source framework for model development, hosting, and usage in production environments.
