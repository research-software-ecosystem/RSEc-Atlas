Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered type of protein post-translational modification and has been reported to be involved in various pathophysiological processes. High-resolution mass spectrometry is the primary approach for identification of Kcr sites. However, experimental approaches for identifying Kcr sites are often time-consuming and expensive when compared with computational approaches. To date, several predictors for Kcr site prediction have been developed, most of which are capable of predicting crotonylation sites on either histones alone or mixed histone and nonhistone proteins together. These methods exhibit high diversity in their algorithms, encoding schemes, feature selection techniques and performance assessment strategies. However, none of them were designed for predicting Kcr sites on nonhistone proteins.","addition_date":"2021-10-25T07:40:56.429160Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:17:28.778839Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"nhKcr","home":"https://bio.tools/nhkcr","summary":"nhKcr is a bioinformatics tool for predicting crotonylation sites on human nonhistone proteins based on deep learning.
