Tamock facilitates the simulation of metagenomic reads according to a microbial community, derived from real metagenomic data. Thus, Tamock simulations enable an assessment of computational methods, workflows and parameters specific for a microbial habitat. Tamock automatically determines taxonomic profiles from shotgun metagenomic data, selects reference genomes accordingly and uses them to simulate metagenomic reads.","addition_date":"2021-12-06T14:46:56.129889Z","last_update_date":"2021-12-06T14:46:56.132492Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Tamock","home":"https://bio.tools/tamock","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Tamock simulates habitat-specific benchmark data for metagenomic samples.
