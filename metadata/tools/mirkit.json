The tool offers fast execution times with low memory usage, can perform the full analysis from the raw RT-PCR data to functional analysis of targeted genes, and is specifically designed to support the popular miScript miRNA PCR Array (Qiagen) technology.","addition_date":"2021-09-20T06:49:28.552326Z","last_update_date":"2022-12-01T22:34:37.796805Z","version":["1.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"mirKit","home":"https://bio.tools/mirkit","license":"MIT","version":"1.0","summary":"miRkit is an open source framework written in R, that allows for the comprehensive analysis of RT-PCR data, from the processing of raw data to a functional analysis of the produced results.
