Different datasets can be integrated into the network by assigning p-values of statistical tests to the nodes of the network. By fitting a beta-uniform mixture model and calculating scores from these p-values, overall scores of network regions can be calculated and an integer linear programming algorithm identifies the maximum scoring subnetwork.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:01:19Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-29T14:35:19Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.34.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BioNet","home":"https://bio.tools/bionet","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.34.0","summary":"This package provides functions for the integrated analysis of protein-protein interaction networks and the detection of functional modules.
