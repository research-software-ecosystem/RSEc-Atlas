However, the process by which pathologists manually recognize and localize all the cells in pathology slides is extremely labor intensive and error prone. METHODS:In this study, we developed an automated cell type classification pipeline, ConvPath, which includes nuclei segmentation, convolutional neural network-based tumor cell, stromal cell, and lymphocyte classification, and extraction of tumor microenvironment-related features for lung cancer pathology images.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:25:43Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-16T17:55:20Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ConvPath","home":"https://bio.tools/ConvPath","summary":"A software tool for lung adenocarcinoma digital pathological image analysis aided by a convolutional neural network.\n\nBACKGROUND:The spatial distributions of different types of cells could reveal a cancer cell's growth pattern, its relationships with the tumor microenvironment and the immune response of the body, all of which represent key \"hallmarks of cancer\".
