It allows for sophisticated selection based on highly structured data sources (datasets) with descriptive data (trait data with descriptors, descriptor categorical states, descriptor values). The browser-based tool is optimized to build and run determination keys based on the consecutive selection of descriptors, descriptor states and values during the identification process. Selection criteria might be predefined by individual user or changed during the identification process.","addition_date":"2024-05-10T13:07:45.104467Z","last_update_date":"2024-05-10T14:18:05.546424Z","tool_type":["Web application"]}}}
