Read Until allows genomic reads to be analyzed in real-time and abandoned halfway, if not belonging to a genomic region of 'interest'. HARU takes advantage of heterogenous edge compute platforms and provides hardware acceleration using reconfigurable hardware on a Multiprocessor system on a chip (MPSoC).","addition_date":"2023-05-13T03:20:56.702744Z","last_update_date":"2023-05-13T03:20:56.705290Z"}}}
