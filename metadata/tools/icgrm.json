It estimates genetic values with genome-wide distributed SNPs instead of pedigree. The key step of it is to construct genomic relationship matrix (GRM) via genome-wide SNPs; however, usually the calculation of GRM needs huge computer memory especially when the SNP number and sample size are big, so that sometimes it will become computationally prohibitive even for super computer clusters.
