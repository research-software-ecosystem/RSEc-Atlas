Rigbox's main goals are to simplify hardware/software interfacing, behavioral task design, and visual and auditory stimuli presentation. Additionally, Rigbox can time-align datastreams from multiple sources and communicate with a remote database to manage experiment data. Rigbox is mostly object-oriented and highly modular, which simplifies the process of designing experiments.
