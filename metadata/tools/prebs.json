The comparability is achieved by summarizing sequencing-based expressions of probe regions using a modified version of RMA algorithm. The pipeline takes mapped reads in BAM format as an input and produces either gene expressions or original microarray probe set expressions as an output.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:03:27Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-11T00:46:54Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.14.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"prebs","home":"https://bio.tools/prebs","license":"Artistic-2.0","version":"1.14.0","summary":"This package aims at making RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data more comparable to microarray data.
