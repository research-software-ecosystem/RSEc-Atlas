It will work on both single-end and paired-end data in fastq format. It simply compares the provided barcodes with each read and separates the read into its appropriate barcode file, after stripping the barcode from the read (and also stripping the quality values of the barcode bases). If a read does not have a recognized barcode, then it is put into the unknown file.","addition_date":"2017-08-20T17:22:23Z","last_update_date":"2019-09-04T08:38:28Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["Animal and Crop Genomics"]}}}
