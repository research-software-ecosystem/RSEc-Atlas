However, when using public-available databases for meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often-encountered problem. Not removing duplicates would make study results questionable. We developed a BioConductor package that efficiently identifies duplicated samples by generating MD5 fingerprints for raw data.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:05:47Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-10T15:36:09Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.12.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DupChecker","home":"https://bio.tools/dupchecker","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.12.0","summary":"Meta-analysis has become a popular approach for high-throughput genomic data analysis because it can significantly increase power to detect biological signals or patterns in datasets.
