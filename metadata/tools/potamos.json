The application is able to calculate: a) the kind, the number and the combinations of  possible PTMs for a  peptide or protein sequence and the corresponding mass, b) the charge of a peptide, protein or protein fragment in  their modified or  unmodified state, c) the protein fragments produced upon proteolytic cleavage of PTM modified proteins and their masses. A particular focus is on PTM-modified histones. A histone variant browser is included in the web application. It could be useful in analysis of mass-spec data for epigenetically  modified histones and other proteins.","addition_date":"2017-09-29T05:05:29Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-20T08:26:30Z","tool_type":["Web service"],"version":["v2.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"POTAMOS","home":"https://bio.tools/potamos","version":"v2.0","summary":"Post-Translational Modifications Mass Spectrometry Calculator is a free web application that simplifies mass spectrometry calculations for post-translationally modified (PTM) proteins.
