It adopts a seeding and extension scheme, and does not rely on a separate external. It achieves high sensitivity of junction detection by using very small seeds, efficiently mapped using Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and FM-index. This also makes it particularly sensitive for discovering small exons. It is implemented in C++ with full support of multiple threading, to allow fast processing of large-scale data.","addition_date":"2017-01-13T13:15:44Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-26T08:33:28Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OLego","home":"https://bio.tools/olego","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Designed for de novo spliced mapping of mRNA-seq reads.
