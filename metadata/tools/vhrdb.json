While it originates from bacteriophages and bacteria interaction studies, its design is compatible with viruses infecting all living forms. Users can browse publicly available data to find which host is infected by a virus, and vice versa. Users can also upload their own data while keeping it private or making it public, analyze results across independent sets of data, generate and visualize outputs. Data implemented in the VHRdb are linked to users and, if available, to publications and sequence identifiers.","addition_date":"2022-02-08T11:13:42.835371Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:07:16.805423Z","tool_type":["Database portal","Web API","Web application"],"version":["1"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Viral Host Range database","home":"https://bio.tools/VHRdb","license":"MIT","version":"1","summary":"The Viral Host Range database represents a unique resource for the community to rapidly find, document analyze and disseminate data related to the range of hosts that a virus can infect.
