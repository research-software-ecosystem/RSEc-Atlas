It is designed to be massively parallelizable using shared objects that prevent memory duplication, and it can be used with different mini-batch approaches in order to reduce time consumption. It assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data with a dispersion parameter that can be both commonwise across gene both genewise."}}}
