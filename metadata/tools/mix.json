The algorithm builds an extension graph where vertices represent extremities of contigs and edges represent existing alignments between these extremities. These alignment edges are used for contig extension. The resulting output assembly corresponds to a path in the extension graph that maximizes the cumulative contig length.","addition_date":"2015-10-29T13:17:28Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:18:36.339969Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Mix","home":"https://bio.tools/mix","license":"MIT","version":"1","summary":"Tool that combines two or more draft assemblies, without relying on a reference genome and has the goal to reduce contig fragmentation and thus speed-up genome finishing.
