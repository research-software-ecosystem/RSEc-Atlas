{"tool_name":"ubds","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"UBDs","home":"https://github.com/UniBioDicts","license":"AGPL-3.0","summary":"Unified Biological Dictionaries (UniBioDicts) is a set of software packages that unite many of the most important biological controlled vocabularies, database vocabularies, and ontologies, under a common query-interface. These packages can access these disparate biological resources, and map their vocabulary data onto a common representation consisting of terms (which biocurators prefer to use), a unique identifier (which computers can reason with), and various descriptive metadata.\n\nThis cross-resource infrastructure is essential for an efficient, modernized biocuration process, as it directly enables the autocomplete-based curation of particularly context-rich annotations, that combine terminology from across biological niches.","addition_date":"2020-07-04T02:23:09Z","last_update_date":"2020-07-04T02:23:24Z","tool_type":["Bioinformatics portal","Database portal","Suite"]}}}
