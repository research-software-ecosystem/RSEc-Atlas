{"tool_name":"r-fftwtools","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-fftwtools","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","summary":"Provides a wrapper for several FFTW functions. This package provides access to the two-dimensional FFT, the multivariate FFT, and the one-dimensional real to complex FFT using FFTW3. The package includes the functions fftw and mvfftw which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions fft and mvfft. The FFT functions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant complex conjugate when the input is real data. "}}}
