It is designed for single variant tests in large-scale phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) with millions of variants and samples, controlling for sample structure and case-control imbalance. The implementation is based on the original SAIGE R package (v0.29.4.4). SAIGEgds also implements some of the SPAtest functions in C to speed up the calculation of Saddlepoint approximation. Benchmarks show that SAIGEgds is 5 to 6 times faster than the original SAIGE R package.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:48:31Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-10T15:17:15Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SAIGEgds","home":"https://bio.tools/saigegds","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Scalable Implementation of Generalized mixed models using GDS files in Phenome-Wide Association Studies.\n\nScalable implementation of generalized mixed models with highly optimized C++ implementation and integration with Genomic Data Structure (GDS) files.
