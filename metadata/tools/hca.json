The bidimensional plot is associated with an alpha helicoidal pitch (3.6 residue/turn, connectivity distance of 4) which has been shown to offer the best correspondence between clusters and regular secondary structures. Examination of the HCA plot of a protein sequence allow to easily identify globular regions from non globular ones and, in globular regions, to identify secondary structures.","addition_date":"2017-12-06T18:14:33Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:47:21.770746Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["Proteomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HCA (hydrophobic cluster analysis)","home":"https://bio.tools/hca","summary":"The HCA method is based on the use of a bidimensional plot, called the HCA plot.
