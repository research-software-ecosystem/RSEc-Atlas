It first collects multiple sequence alignments using PSI-BLAST. Amino-acid frequence and log-odds data with Henikoff weights are then used to train secondary structure, separately, based on the Rumelhart error backpropagation method. The final secondary structure prediction result is a combination of 7 neural network predictors from different profile data and parameters.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:10:39Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:44:15.222267Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["v2"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PSSpred","home":"https://bio.tools/psspred","version":"v2","summary":"A simple neural network training algorithm for accurate protein secondary structure prediction.
