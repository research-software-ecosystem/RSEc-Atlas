InfiniumPurify is an integrated R pa ckage for est imatin g and accoun ting for tum or puri ty based on DNA methylation Infinium 450 k array data. InfiniumPurify has three main functions getPurity, InfiniumDMC and InfiniumClust, which could infer tumor purity, differential methylation analysis and tumor sample c luster accounting for estimated or user-provided tumor purities, respectively. The InfiniumPurify package provides a comprehensive analysis of tumor purity in cancer methylation research.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:22:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-14T08:07:40Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"InfiniumPurify-R","home":"https://bio.tools/InfiniumPurify-R","summary":"Detection of differentially methylated CpG sites between tumor samples with uneven tumor purities.\n\nR package for DNA methylation analysis.\n\nR package for DNA methylation analysis The proposition of cancer cells in a tumor sample, named as tumor purity, is an intrinsic factor of tumor samples and has potentially great influence in variety of analyses including differential methylation, subclonal deconvolution and subtype clustering.
