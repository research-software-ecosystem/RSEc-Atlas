It automatizes all the necessary preliminary steps for evolutionary analyses, including retrieval of homologs, assignment to orthology groups, codon alignment and reconstruction of gene phylogeny. Following the obtention of the alignements and corresponding phylogenies, three major genetic innovations are detected: duplication events, recombination events, and signatures of positive selection.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:33:18Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:41:13.716470Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"DGINN","home":"https://bio.tools/dginn","summary":"DGINN is an automated and highly-flexible pipeline for the Detection of Genetic INNovations on protein-coding genes.
