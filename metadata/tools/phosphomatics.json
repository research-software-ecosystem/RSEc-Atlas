Our aim is to help you connect the phosphorylation sties that you observe in your mass spectrometry experiments to known upstream kinases. This provides a greater understanding of the regulatory signaling networks operating in your systems.\n\nYou will be automatically redirected to your results once they're ready.\n\nThis may take a minute or two depending on the size of your input data and our server utilisation.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:17:54Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-23T15:28:23Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Phosphomatics","home":"https://bio.tools/phosphomatics","summary":"Interactive interrogation of substrate-kinase networks in global phosphoproteomics datasets.\n\nPhosphomatics helps you make sense of your high-throughput phosphoproteomics data.
