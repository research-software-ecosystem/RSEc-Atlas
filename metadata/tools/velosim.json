Given the cell developmental trajectory backbone, e.g. tree, cycle, cycle-tree, etc, VeloSim is able to simulate the whole dynamics of mRNA molecule generation, produces unspliced mRNA count matrix, spliced mRNA count matrix and RNA velocity at the same time. VeloSim can be easily used to benchmark trajectory inference and RNA velocity inference methods.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:31:33Z","last_update_date":"2021-07-07T11:57:19Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"VeloSim","home":"https://bio.tools/velosim","summary":"Simulating single cell gene-expression and RNA velocity.\n\nVeloSim is a simulation package that generates single-cell RNA Sequencing data for continuous cell developmental process.
