The visualization produced is a matrix of hive plots plotted using attributes of the nodes and edges (such as degree and centrality). The interactive features let users explore their network and discover patterns in their network. For more information on the design of the tool and on the kind of patterns it can reveal, check out Sarah Perez's Master Thesis.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:11:11Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:46:16.215687Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Hive_Panel_Explorer","home":"https://bio.tools/hive_panel_explorer","summary":"An interactive network visualization tool.\n\nUpdate: Interactive hive panels can be easily built using different data formats.
