If the atomic structure of the bound complex is known, it can be used to calculate bimolecular association rates. It can also be used to record Brownian dynamics trajectories or encounter complexes and calculate bimolecular electron transfer rate constants.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:59:19Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:54:38.247563Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SDA","home":"https://bio.tools/sda-simulate","summary":"The tool simulates the diffusional association of two proteins/molecules or a protein/molecule to a solid state surface.
