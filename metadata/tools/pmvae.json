It uses pathway module sub networks to construct a latent space factorized by pathway gene sets. Each pathway has a corresponding module which behaves as a mini VAE acting only on the participating genes. These modules produce latent representations that can be direcrly interpreted within the context of a specific pathway. To account for overlapping pathway gene sets (due to e.g. signaling hierarchies) we have a custom training procedure to encourage module independence.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:13:25Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-28T12:34:41Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"pmVAE","home":"https://bio.tools/pmvae","license":"MIT","summary":"Learning Interpretable Single-Cell Representations with Pathway Modules.\n\npmVAE leverages biological prior information in the form of pathway gene sets to construct interpretable representations of single-cell data.
