It provides an interface to navigate through virus genome sequences, to design ORF-specific cloning primers, to validate the sequence of generated constructs and to browse established collections of virus ORFs. It has been designed to manage all possible variants or mutants of a given ORF so that the cloning procedure can be applied to any emerging virus strain.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T07:20:00Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:09:43.094418Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ViralORFeome","home":"https://bio.tools/viralorfeome","summary":"Database and management system that provides an integrated set of bioinformatic tools to clone viral ORFs in the Gateway(R) system.
