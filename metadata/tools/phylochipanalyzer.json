It operates in two modes: first, the hierarchy of probes is defined interactively, second, the intensity data of a hybridized chip is loaded and analyzed according to the hierarchy. The program can export hierarchy trees to Newick-format and analyzed data to Excel. It contains a Delphi-script that makes it configurable with respect to different criteria for positive signals.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:11:02Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:47:58.710286Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PhylochipAnalyzer","home":"https://bio.tools/phylochipanalyzer","version":"1.0","summary":"PhylochipAnalyzer is a Windows-program for the analysis of experiments with hierarchical probe-sets.
