The first version, EvoEF1, includes five energy terms with parameters optimized on two large sets of thermodynamics mutation data (\u0394\u0394Gstability and \u0394\u0394Gbind), while the second version, EvoEF2, includes nine energy terms and optimized based on recapitulation of protein sequence design. Extensive benchmark and analysis showed that the usefulness of energy functions is highly correlated with the parameter optimization processes. While EvoEF1 performs better than EvoEF2 on \u0394\u0394G estimation, EvoEF2 significantly outperforms EvoEF2 on de novo protein sequence design. Therefore, we suggest users download the two versions according to their own needs.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:56:53Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:52:13.337671Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EvoEF2","home":"https://bio.tools/EvoEF2","license":"MIT","summary":"Accurate and fast energy function for computational protein design.\n\nenergy potential for protein design.\n\nEvoEF is a composite energy force field that contains two versions.
