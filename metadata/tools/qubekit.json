Here we present an intuitive parameter derivation toolkit, QUBEKit (QUantum mechanical BEspoke Kit), which enables the automated generation of system-specific small molecule force field parameters directly from quantum mechanics. QUBEKit is written in python and combines the latest QM parameter derivation methodologies with a novel method for deriving the positions and charges of off-center virtual sites.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:59:50Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-11T15:09:32Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"QUBEKit","home":"https://bio.tools/QUBEKit","summary":"Automating the Derivation of Force Field Parameters from Quantum Mechanics.\n\n<div><div><div><p>Modern molecular mechanics force fields are widely used for modelling the dynamics and interactions of small organic molecules using libraries of transferable force field parameters.
