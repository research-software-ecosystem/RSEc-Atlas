This is generally performed by aligning sequences to a reference database, usually resulting in multiple database alignments for each query sequence. Using these alignment results, metabinkit assigns a single taxon to each query sequence, based on user-defined percentage identity thresholds. In essence, for each query, the alignments are filtered based on the percentage identity thresholds and the lowest common ancestor for all alignments passing the filters is determined. The metabin program is not limited to BLAST alignments, and can accept alignment results produced using any program, provided the input format is correct. However, functionality is also available to create BLAST databases and to perform BLAST alignments, which can be passed directly to metabin."}}}
