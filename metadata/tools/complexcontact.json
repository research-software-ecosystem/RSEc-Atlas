It applies an ultra-deep learning model trained from single-chain proteins to predict contacts for a pair of proteins. This deep learning method greatly outperforms the latest co-evolution methods by learning contact occurrence patterns from solved protein structures.","addition_date":"2018-07-01T15:37:29Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ComplexContact","home":"https://bio.tools/complexcontact","summary":"Predicts the interfacial contacts between two potentially interacting protein sequences (heterodimer only) using co-evolution and deep learning techniques.
