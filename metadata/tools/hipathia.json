The method is based on an iterative algorithm which is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a network by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and the intensity of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a new approach to functional analysis allowing to compute the signal arriving to the functions annotated to each pathway.","addition_date":"2018-07-19T20:45:28Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:50:54.987710Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"hipathia","home":"https://bio.tools/hipathia","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.0.0","summary":"Hipathia is a method for the computation of signal transduction along signaling pathways from transcriptomic data.
