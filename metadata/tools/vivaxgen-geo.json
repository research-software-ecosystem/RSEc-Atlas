Traditionally, patient travel history has been used to identify imported cases, but the long-latency liver stages confound this approach in Plasmodium vivax. Molecular tools to identify and map imported cases offer a more robust approach, that can be combined with drug resistance and other surveillance markers in high-throughput, population-based genotyping frameworks.
