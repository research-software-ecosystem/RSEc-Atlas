More than typical k-mer counting tool, the program can summarize the exact counting result of  1-mers to  l-mers at once where l = the length of longest repeated substring in the input sequence which now is set the maximum length to 100000-mers.  The program can  report exactly the number of all repeat (freq>1) and unique(freq = 1) mers , and the number of all possible substrings of the sequence without cutting off any low frequency mers.","addition_date":"2023-07-28T07:50:21.308396Z","last_update_date":"2023-07-28T08:13:02.596100Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Universal-mer","home":"https://bio.tools/universal-mer","license":"Freeware","version":"1.0.0","summary":"Universal-mer is the k-mer counting tool for all possible size of k at once.
