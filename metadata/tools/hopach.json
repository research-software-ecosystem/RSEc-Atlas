The non-parametric bootstrap allows one to estimate the probability that each element belongs to each cluster.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:00:43Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T16:06:34.696820Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["2.34.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"hopach","home":"https://bio.tools/hopach","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"2.34.0","summary":"This algorithm builds a hierarchical tree of clusters by recursively partitioning a data set, while ordering and possibly collapsing clusters at each level.
