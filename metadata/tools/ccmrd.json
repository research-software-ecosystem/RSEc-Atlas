Carbohydrates play key roles in many life activities in living organisms. As an emerging technique with steadily improving resolution, solid-state NMR spectroscopy has the unique capability in revealing the molecular structure and dynamics of insoluble complex carbohydrates. We developed and implemented CCMRD, Complex Carbohydrates Magnetic Resonance Database, a solid-state NMR database for complex carbohydrates. Currently, it holds more than 400 solid-state NMR spectra and expects rapid expansion. The database supports searching by atom, chemical shifts and residue names.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:01:27Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-09T07:56:31Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CCMRD","home":"https://bio.tools/ccmrd","summary":"Complex Carbohydrate Magnetic Resonance Database (CCMRD) is a solid-state NMR database for complex carbohydrates.
