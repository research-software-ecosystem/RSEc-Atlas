The independent testing datasets proves that mRNALocater is a comprehensive and advanced predictor.","addition_date":"2021-10-11T08:23:23.758120Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:17:57.223930Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"mRNALocater","home":"https://bio.tools/mrnalocater","summary":"mRNALocater is a comprehensive and advanced model to accuracy prtiction of eukaryotic mRNA subcellular localization.Three different machine learning models with relatively stable performance based on the optimal feature subset using algorithms including XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost are constructed.
