Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a common genomic alteration in colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, and other solid tumors. MSI is characterized by a high degree of polymorphism in microsatellite lengths owing to the deficiency in the mismatch repair system. Based on the degree, MSI can be classified as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and microsatellite stable (MSS). MSI is a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy in advanced/metastatic solid tumors, especially in colorectal cancer patients. Several computational approaches based on target panel sequencing data have been used to detect MSI; however, they are considerably affected by the sequencing depth and panel size.","addition_date":"2021-10-11T08:47:56.394872Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-11T08:47:56.397610Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MSIFinder","home":"https://bio.tools/msifinder","summary":"MSIFinder is a python package for detecting Microsatellite instability (MSI) status using random forest classifier.
