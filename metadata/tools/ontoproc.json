We provide snapshots of key ontologies for terms about cells, cell lines, chemical compounds, and anatomy, to help analyze genome-scale experiments, particularly cell x compound screens. Another purpose is to strengthen development of compelling use cases for richer interfaces to emerging ontologies.","addition_date":"2018-07-24T15:41:51Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.2.1"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
