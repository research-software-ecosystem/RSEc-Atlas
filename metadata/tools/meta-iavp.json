Recently, the discovery of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has become an influential antiviral agent due to their extraordinary advantages. With the avalanche of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, there is a great demand to develop a sequence-based predictor for timely identifying AVPs as this information is very useful for both basic research and drug development. In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor with an effective feature representation, called Meta-iAVP, for the accurate prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences. Herein, the effective feature representation was extracted from a set of prediction scores derived from various machine learning algorithms and types of features","addition_date":"2020-01-14T08:51:57Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-23T08:55:12Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Meta-iAVP","home":"https://bio.tools/Meta-iAVP","summary":"A Sequence-Based Meta-Predictor for Improving the Prediction of Antiviral Peptides Using Effective Feature Representation.\n\nIn spite of the large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses remain a prominent human disease.
