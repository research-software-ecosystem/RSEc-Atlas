Recent advancements in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq) technologies make it possible to detect the binding peaks of a given RNA binding protein (RBP) at transcriptome scale. However, it is still challenging to predict the functional consequences of RBP binding peaks. In this study, we propose the Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), which integrates the intensities and positions of the binding peaks of RBPs for functional mRNA targets prediction. We illustrate the superiority of PRAS over existing approaches on predicting the functional targets of two related but divergent CELF (CUGBP, ELAV-like factor) RBPs in mouse brain and muscle","addition_date":"2019-11-14T17:59:51Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-05T14:59:14Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PRAS","home":"https://bio.tools/PRAS","summary":"> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | Predicting functional targets of RNA binding proteins based on CLIP-seq peaks | RNA-protein interaction plays important roles in post-transcriptional regulation.
