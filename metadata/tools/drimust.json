In particular, DRIMUST can efficiently search for variable gapped motifs, long motifs and motifs over large alphabets. The motif structure that DRIMUST searches comprises two half sites separated by a gap, that can be of a variable length.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:05:43Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:57:10.954230Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DRIMust","home":"https://bio.tools/drimust","version":"1.0","summary":"DRIMUST is a software implementation of a new statistical and algorithmic approach that we developed to enable efficient motif searches, covering a broader range of motif spaces comparing with state of the art motif searching tools.
