The tool currently implements three online MUS enumeration algorithms: MARCO [9], TOME [2], and ReMUS [3], and supports MUS enumeration in three constraint domains: SAT, SMT, and LTL. A paper [1] describing MUST will be presented at TACAS 2020.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:31:41Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:40:51.913688Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
