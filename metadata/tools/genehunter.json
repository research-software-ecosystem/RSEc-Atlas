The multipoint inheritance information allows the reconstruction of maximum-likelihood haplotypes for all individuals in the pedigree and information content mapping which measures the fraction of the total inheritance information extracted from the marker data.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:06:43Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-15T03:06:16Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.1"]}}}
