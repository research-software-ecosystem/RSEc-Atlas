It will output the names and locations of candidate gene fusions along with the cDNA sequence of their breakpoints. JAFFA is based on the idea of comparing a transcriptome (e.g. in a cancer sample) against a reference transcriptome. In this way, it is a transcript-centric approach rather than a genome-centric approach like other fusion finders. In validation studies, JAFFA performed well over a range of read lengths - from 50bp to full-length transcripts and on single and paired-end reads.
