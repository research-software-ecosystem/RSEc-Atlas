The R package crossrun.\n\nThe R package crossrun computes the joint distribution of the number of crossings and the longest run in a sequence of independent Bernoulli observations. The main intended application is statistical process control where the joint distribution may be used for systematic investigation, and possibly refinement, of existing rules for distinguishing between signal and noise. While the crossrun vignette is written to assist in practical use, this article gives a hands-on explanation of why the procedures works. The article also includes a discussion of limitations of the present version of crossrun together with an outline of ongoing work to meet these limitations.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:34:00Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-17T08:56:59Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"crossrun","home":"https://bio.tools/crossrun","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Joint distribution for number of crossings and longest run in independent Bernoulli observations.
