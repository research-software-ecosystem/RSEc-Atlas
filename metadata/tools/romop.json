Briefly, OMOP is a standardized relational database schema for Electronic Health Record (EHR) or Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data (i.e., patient data collected during clinical visits to a health system). The main benefit of a standardized schema is that it allows for interoperability between institutions, even if the underlying EHR vendors are disparate.\n\nBenjamin S.
