DESIGN:Descriptive. METHODS:Use cases are described for performing a common actigraphy task in ACTman and alternative actigraphy software. Important inefficiencies in actigraphy workflow are identified and their consequences are described. We explain how these hinder the feasibility of conducting studies with large groups of athletes and or longer data collection periods. Thereafter, the information flow through the ACTman software is described and we explain how it alleviates aforementioned inefficiencies.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:42:16Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-14T14:54:50Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ACTman","home":"https://bio.tools/ACTman","summary":"Automated preprocessing and analysis of actigraphy data.\n\nOBJECTIVES:To introduce a novel software-library called Actigraphy Manager (ACTman) which automates labor-intensive actigraphy data preprocessing and analyses steps while improving transparency, reproducibility, and scalability over software suites traditionally used in actigraphy research practice.
