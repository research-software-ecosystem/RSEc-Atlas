It offers pre-calculated geometric descriptors at the helix-packing interface. It also includes the corresponding sequence, topology, lipid accessibility, ligand-binding information and supports structural classification, schematic diagrams and visualization of the above structural features of TM helix-packing.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T08:35:20Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:50Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
