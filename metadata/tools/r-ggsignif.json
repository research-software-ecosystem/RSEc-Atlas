{"tool_name":"r-ggsignif","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-ggsignif","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL-3","summary":"Enrich your 'ggplots' with group-wise comparisons. This package provides an easy way to indicate if two groups are significantly different. Commonly this is shown by a bracket on top connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS, *, **, ***). The package provides a single layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds the annotation to the plot."}}}
