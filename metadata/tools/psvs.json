It integrates analyses from several widely-used structure quality evaluation tools. It provides standard constraint analyses, statistics on the PDB validation goodness-of-fit between structures and experimental data, and knowledge-based structure quality scores in standardized format suitable for database integration. Global quality measures are reported as Z scores, based on calibration with a set of high-resolution X-ray crystal structures.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:54:53Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:42:04.738455Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PSVS","home":"https://bio.tools/psvs","summary":"It evaluates the quality of protein structures.
