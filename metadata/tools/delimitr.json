Most approaches to species delimitation to date have considered divergence-only models. Although these models are appropriate for allopatric speciation, their failure to incorporate many of the population-level processes that drive speciation, such as gene flow (e.g., in sympatric speciation), places an unnecessary limit on our collective understanding of the processes that produce biodiversity. To consider these processes while inferring species boundaries, we introduce the R-package delimitR and apply it to identify species boundaries in the reticulate taildropper slug (Prophysaon andersoni). Results suggest that secondary contact is an important mechanism driving speciation in this system.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:40:32Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-20T12:13:18Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"delimitR","home":"https://bio.tools/delimitR","license":"MIT","summary":"Process-based species delimitation leads to identification of more biologically relevant species.
