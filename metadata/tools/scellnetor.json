With Scellnetor you can compare two sets of cells that you manually select on one of your Scanpy-generated plots. The output will be connected components of genes where the genes are either differently or similarly expressed in the two sets. You can also do a clustering of a single set, where the genes in the connected components are similarly expressed. For every cluster, you get a plot showing mean gene expression and the genes' 95 % confidence intervals and a table with statistically significant GO-terms.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:37:50Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T17:42:29Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Scellnetor","home":"https://bio.tools/scellnetor","license":"MIT","summary":"Comparative single-cell trajectory network enrichment identifies pseudo-temporal systems biology patterns in hematopoiesis and CD8 T-cell development.\n\nScellnetor is a Single Cell Network Profiler for Extraction of Systems Biology Patterns from scRNAseq Trajectories.\n\nFirst time using Scellnetor or need help?.\n\nScellnetor is a novel clustering tool for scRNA-seq data that takes Scanpy generated AnnData objects in H5AD file-format as input.
