It \u00e5rovides several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge, including popular methods for identifying miRNA sponge interactions, two types of global ceRNA regulation prediction methods and four types of context-specific prediction methods, which are based on miRNA-messenger RNA regulation alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data, respectively. In addition, For predictive ceRNA relationship pairs, this package provides several downstream analysis algorithms, including regulatory network analysis and functional annotation analysis, as well as survival prognosis analysis based on expression of ceRNA ternary pair.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:03:10Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-10T20:46:22Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CeRNASeek","home":"https://bio.tools/cernaseek","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"CeRNASeek is an R package for identification and analysis of ceRNA regulation.
