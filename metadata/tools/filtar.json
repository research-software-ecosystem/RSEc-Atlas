Its primary purpose is to provide context-specific miRNA target prediction in vertebrates. This is achieved by integrating RNA-Seq data into existing miRNA target prediction workflows, allowing users to filter target predictions on the basis of expression information and to tailor 3'UTR annotations for specific cellular contexts, increasing the specificity of target predictions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T06:57:56Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-11T08:57:40Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FilTar","home":"https://bio.tools/filtar","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"FilTar is a tool to integrate RNA-Seq data to pre-existing miRNA target prediction workflows in order to increase prediction accuracy.
