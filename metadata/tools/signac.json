It helps to find marker genes faster and more accurate, search for cells with similar expression profiles, integrate multiple datasets in the BioTuring Browser database (know more about BioTuring Browser), etc. For users with a limited computational resource, we provide the helper functions to exercise all analyses for the large-scale datasets from disk. Because of its speed and flexibility, it can be adapted to any existing R analysis pipeline to help explore single-cell data more efficient.\n\nSignac is an extension of Seurat for the analysis of single-cell chromatin data.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:49:42Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-18T17:31:47Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Signac","home":"https://bio.tools/signac","summary":"Multimodal single-cell chromatin analysis with Signac.\n\nA New Algorithm for Finding Marker Genes in Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data.\n\nSignac - A versatile package for Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis.\n\nWe introduce Signac, a versatile R package to facilitate the analysis workflow for single-cell data.
