It accomplishes this by identifying repeat haplotype patterns and using these to simplify the underlying calculations, with no loss of accuracy. It uses M3VCF files to store reference panel information in a compact form. M3VCF files can also store pre-calculated estimates of recombination fraction and error, which speeds up later rounds of imputation.","addition_date":"2017-08-20T15:58:01Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:02:00.860773Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["Animal and Crop Genomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Minimac3","home":"https://bio.tools/minimac3","license":"Not licensed","summary":"It is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more computationally efficient way with no loss of accuracy.
