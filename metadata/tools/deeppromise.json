To date, more than 160 RNA modifications have been discovered; therefore, accurate identification of RNA-modification sites is fundamental for a better understanding of RNA-mediated biological functions and mechanisms. However, due to limitations in experimental methods, systematic identification of different types of RNA-modification sites remains a major challenge. Recently, more than 20 computational methods have been developed to identify RNA-modification sites in tandem with high-throughput experimental methods, with most of these capable of predicting only single types of RNA-modification sites","addition_date":"2020-01-14T08:58:28Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-20T11:25:51Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DeepPromise","home":"https://bio.tools/DeepPromise","summary":"Comprehensive review and assessment of computational methods for predicting RNA post-transcriptional modification sites from RNA sequences.\n\nRNA post-transcriptional modifications play a crucial role in a myriad of biological processes and cellular functions.
