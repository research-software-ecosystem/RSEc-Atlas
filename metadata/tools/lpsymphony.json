These packages provide an R interface to SYMPHONY, an open-source linear programming solver written in C++. The main difference between this package and Rsymphony is that it includes the solver source code (SYMPHONY version 5.6), while Rsymphony expects to find header and library files on the users' system. Thus, the intention is to provide an easy to install interface to SYMPHONY.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:04:36Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:51Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.2.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"lpsymphony","home":"https://bio.tools/lpsymphony","license":"EPL-1.0","version":"1.2.0","summary":"This package was derived from Rsymphony_0.1-17 from CRAN.
