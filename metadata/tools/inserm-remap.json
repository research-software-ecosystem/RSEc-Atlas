ReMap (https://remap.univ-amu.fr) aims to provide manually curated, high-quality catalogs of regulatory regions resulting from a large-scale integrative analysis of DNA-binding experiments in Human, Mouse, Fly and Arabidopsis thaliana for hundreds of transcription factors and regulators. In this 2022 update, we have uniformly processed >11 000 DNA-binding sequencing datasets from public sources across four species. The four regulatory catalogs are browsable through track hubs at UCSC, Ensembl and NCBI genome browsers.","addition_date":"2016-02-10T09:42:32Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:21:26.315951Z","tool_type":["Database portal"],"version":["2014","2018","2020","2022"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ReMap","home":"https://bio.tools/inserm-remap","license":"CC-BY-NC-4.0","version":["2022","2014","2020","2018"],"summary":"ReMap is a large scale integrative analysis of DNA-binding experiments for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional regulators.
