There are 6 built-in models and you can choose a proper one. If your data is some species not included in the 4 species (O. sativa, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens), you can choose the Compre or Compre2 model. Compre model is trained by comprehensive samples without redunction of dedundancy and Compre2 model is trained by non-redundant comprehensive dataset.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:35:53Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-15T14:28:47Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"p6mA","home":"https://bio.tools/p6ma","summary":"Identification of DNA N6-methyladenine sites by integration of sequence features.\n\np6mA is a N^6-methyladenine predictor which is trained by multiple species' data.
