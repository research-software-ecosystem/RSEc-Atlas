Thus, various computational algorithms have been proposed for protein complex detection. However, most of these methods are based on only topological information and are sensitive to the reliability of interactions. As a result, their performance is affected by false-positive interactions in PPINs. Moreover, these methods consider only density and modularity and ignore protein complexes with various densities and modularities","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:34:10Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-18T08:44:02Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SE-DMTG","home":"https://bio.tools/SE-DMTG","summary":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A seed-extended algorithm for detecting protein complexes based on density and modularity with topological structure and GO annotations | BACKGROUND:The detection of protein complexes is of great significance for researching mechanisms underlying complex diseases and developing new drugs.
