Since version 2.7.0, it can analyze data from digestion protocols as well as data from protocols that do not require restriction enzyme such as DNase Hi-C. The pipeline is flexible, scalable and optimized. It can operate either on a single laptop or on a computational cluster using the PBS-Torque scheduler.","addition_date":"2016-09-27T14:11:00Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-11T01:58:50Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.7.8"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HiC-Pro","home":"https://bio.tools/hic-pro","version":"2.7.8","summary":"This tool was designed to process Hi-C data, from raw fastq files (paired-end Illumina data) to the normalized contact maps.
