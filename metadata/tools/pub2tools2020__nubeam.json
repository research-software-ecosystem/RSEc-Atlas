It represents nucleotides by matrices, transforms a read into a product of matrices, and based on which assigns numbers to reads. A sequencing sample, which is a collection of reads, becomes a collection of numbers that form an empirical distribution. Then the genetic difference between samples is quantified by the distance between empirical distributions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:00:53Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-13T18:44:02Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Nubeam","home":"https://bio.tools/pub2tools2020__nubeam","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"The Nubeam reference-free approach to analyze metagenomic sequencing reads.\n\nNubeam is a reference-free approach to analyze short sequencing reads.
