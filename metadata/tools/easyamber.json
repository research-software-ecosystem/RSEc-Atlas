EasyAmber is a set of wrapper scripts to automate the molecular dynamics routines implemented in the Amber package. The toolbox can address a wide set of tasks in computational biology struggling to account for protein flexibility, and supports the full-atom model building, optimization/equilibration of the molecular system, classical/conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. The easyAmber software takes the molecular dynamics to the next level in terms of usability for complex processing of large volumes of data. It implements advanced MD protocols, but is highly automated and easy-to-operate to attract a broad audience. The toolbox can be used on a personal desktop station equipped with a gaming GPU-accelerator, as well as help to manage huge workloads on a powerful supercomputer.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:22:14Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-05T14:55:59Z","tool_type":["Script","Suite"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"easyAmber","home":"https://bio.tools/easyamber","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"EasyAmber is a comprehensive toolbox to automate the molecular dynamics simulation of proteins.
