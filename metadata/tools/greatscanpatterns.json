A complete analysis runs: detection of all possible periods from the positions of the genomic features, clustering of genomic features that are \u201cin-phase\u201d for every significant period found, and mapping of all the regions of the genome showing periodicities. Each step generates rich and interactive visualisations as well as machine-readable files.","addition_date":"2016-03-24T17:30:49Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-05T13:15:52Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Web application"],"version":["1"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GREAT:SCAN:patterns","home":"https://bio.tools/greatscanpatterns","version":"1","summary":"Performs an automated and systematic analysis of periodic patterns in the position of a set of genomic features of interest along the genome.
