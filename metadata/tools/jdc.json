Some proposed methods for identifying essential proteins have better results by using biological information. Gene expression data is generally used to identify essential proteins. However, gene expression data is prone to fluctuations, which may affect the accuracy of essential protein identification. Therefore, we propose an essential protein identification method to calculate the similarity of \"active\" and \"inactive\" state of gene expression in a cluster of the PPI network based on gene expression and the PPI network data. Our experiments show that our method can improve the accuracy in predicting essential proteins.","addition_date":"2021-10-04T08:38:14.115202Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-04T08:38:14.117861Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"JDC","home":"https://bio.tools/jdc","summary":"JDC is a novel essential protein identification method based on protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) and gene expression data.
