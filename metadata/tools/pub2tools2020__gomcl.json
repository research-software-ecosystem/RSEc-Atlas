It clusters GO terms using MCL based on overlapping ratios, OC (Overlap coefficient) or JC (Jaccard coefficient). The resulting clusters can be further analyzed and separated into sub-clusters using a second script, GOMCL-sub. This tool helps researchers to reduce time spent on manual curation of large lists of GO terms and minimize biases introduced by shared GO terms in data interpretation.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:32:03Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-25T08:57:38Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GOMCL","home":"https://bio.tools/pub2tools2020__gomcl","summary":"A toolkit to cluster, evaluate, and extract non-redundant associations of Gene Ontology-based functions.\n\nGOMCL is a tool to cluster and extract summarized associations of Gene Ontology based functions in omics data.
