Using the direct collocation method, Moco can solve a wide range of problems, including motion tracking, motion prediction, and parameter optimization. The design of Moco focuses on ease-of-use, customizability, and extensibility. Just like OpenSim itself, Moco has interfaces in XML/command-line, Matlab, Python, Java, and C++.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:07:51Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T13:55:47Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Open-Sim Moco","home":"https://bio.tools/Open-Sim_Moco","summary":"Musculoskeletal optimal control.\n\nOpenSim Moco solves optimal control problems with musculoskeletal models defined in OpenSim, using direct collocation.\n\nOpenSim Moco is a software toolkit to solve optimal control problems with musculoskeletal models defined in OpenSim, including those with kinematic constraints.
