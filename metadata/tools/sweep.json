Primarily, it uses the Long Range Haplotype (LRH) test to look for alleles of high frequency with long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), which suggest the haplotype rapidly rose to high frequency before recombination could break down associations with nearby markers","addition_date":"2017-08-20T15:59:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-19T13:26:06Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["Animal and Crop Genomics"]}}}
