The scripts include automated correction of acquisition time delay, assignment of ionization sates in corrected TOF, and quadratic calibration from TOF to M/Z domain based on known +1 standards and their auto-detected ionization states.","addition_date":"2021-05-05T10:48:52Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-07T19:47:20Z","tool_type":["Suite"],"version":["1.0.0.0"],"collections":["File Exchange","MATLAB"]}}}
