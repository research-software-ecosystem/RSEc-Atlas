The GDSArray package implements the `GDSArray` class to represent nodes in GDS files in a matrix-like representation that allows easy manipulation (e.g., subsetting, mathematical transformation) in _R_. The data remains on disk until needed, so that very large files can be processed.","addition_date":"2018-07-08T16:45:18Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
