It performs brute force alignment using a variant on the \"bitap\" algorithm that aligns several thousand reads to a reference in parallel. It uses bit-parallelism, multiple processors, and Cell SPUs if available.\nIt will find alignments with any number of errors up to a user specified cutoff. The emphasis is on doing a 100% accurate search as fast as is possible.","addition_date":"2017-01-13T13:15:37Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
