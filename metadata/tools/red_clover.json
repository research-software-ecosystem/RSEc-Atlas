Using Targeted Genomic Amplicon Sequencing and RNA-seq.\n\nRed clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a diploid, naturally cross-pollinated, cool-season species. As a perennial forage legume, red clover is mostly cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. Being a non-model crop species, genomic resources for red clover have been underdeveloped. Thus far, genomic analysis used in red clover has mainly relied on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. However, SSR markers are sparse in the genome and it is often difficult to unambiguously map them using short reads generated by next generation sequencing technology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been successfully applied in genomics assisted breeding in several agriculturally important species.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:52:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-15T19:06:25Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"red clover","home":"https://bio.tools/red_clover","summary":"Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in Red Clover (Trifolium pratense L.)
