While best-practice data analysis workflows try to tackle these challenges, many existing workflows still grapple with scalability issues, limited portability due to tight coupling with the execution environment and accessibility constraints arising from the absence of user-friendly interfaces. To overcome these issues, we created CloWM, a comprehensive cloud-based workflow management platform that allows the generic transformation of command-line driven workflows into user-friendly web-based services. CloWM offers the seamless integration of (1) scientific workflows written in the Nextflow DSL, (2) robust data storage, (3) a highly scalable compute layer for data-intensive analysis tasks and (4) a user-friendly interface.","addition_date":"2025-04-09T13:19:17.715967Z","last_update_date":"2025-04-09T14:21:50.981521Z","tool_type":["Bioinformatics portal","Web API","Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Cloud-based Workflow Manager (CloWM)","home":"https://bio.tools/clowm","license":"Apache-2.0","summary":"Data analysis in the life sciences often suffers from reproducibility, standardization and accessibility issues and these problems become even more severe with the escalating volume and complexity of data.
