PPINs can be uploaded either from the STRING database or from a user database, and for each of the following 5 aligners: AligNet, HubAlign, LGraal, Pinalog, and Spinal, PINAWeb outputs the alignments produced, as well as their associated topological and biological correctness scores. When more than one aligner is considered, it also reports a comparison of the obtained results. The source code of PINAWeb is freely available on GitHub to enable researchers to add other aligners, network databases or alignment score metrics.","addition_date":"2021-11-01T14:53:55.037285Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-01T14:53:55.039865Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PINAWeb","home":"https://bio.tools/pinaweb","summary":"PINAWeb (Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Aligners) is a user-friendly web-based tool to obtain and compare the results produced by different aligners.
