{"tool_name":"rubic","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"rubic","home":"https://github.com/NKI-CCB/RUBIC","summary":"RUBIC detects recurrent copy number aberrations using copy number breaks, rather than recurrently amplified or deleted regions. This allows for a vastly simplified approach as recursive peak splitting procedures and repeated re-estimation of the background model are avoided. Furthermore, the false discovery rate is controlled on the level of called regions, rather than at the probe level.","addition_date":"2021-04-22T14:45:22Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-22T14:45:22Z","version":["v1.0.3"]}}}
