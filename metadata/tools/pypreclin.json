However, there is no standardized method for monkey fMRI data analysis, specifically for data preprocessing. The preprocessing of monkey fMRI data is challenged by several technical and experimental specificities of the monkey research such as artifacts related to body movements or to intracranial leads. Here we propose to address these challenges by developing a new versatile pipeline for macaque fMRI preprocessing. We developed a Python module, Pypreclin, to process raw images using state of the art algorithms embedded in a fully automatic pipeline. To evaluate its robustness, we applied Pypreclin to fMRI data acquired at 3T in both awake and anesthetized macaques, with or without iron oxide contrast agent, using single loop or multichannel phased-array coils, combined or not with intracranial implanted electrodes.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:18:05Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-13T18:22:24Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Pypreclin","home":"https://bio.tools/Pypreclin","summary":"An automatic pipeline for macaque functional MRI preprocessing.\n\nNon-human primate functional MRI (fMRI) is a growing field in neuroscience.
