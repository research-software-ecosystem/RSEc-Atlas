Identification can be launched in the X!Tandem style, by using as sole parameter the path to a parameter file. But it also provides extended syntax and functions to streamline launching analyses, as well as function to convert results, parameters and taxonomy to/from R. A related package, shinyTANDEM, provides visualization interface for result objects.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:04:52Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:13:31.956551Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.14.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"rTANDEM","home":"https://bio.tools/rtandem","license":"Artistic-1.0","version":"1.14.0","summary":"This package interfaces the tandem protein identification algorithm in R.
