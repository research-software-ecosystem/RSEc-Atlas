Our algorithm, TADA, uses available data and a statistical generative model to create new samples augmenting existing ones, addressing issues of low-sample-size. In generating new samples, TADA takes into account phylogenetic relationships between microbial species. Adding these synthetic samples to the training set improves the accuracy of downstream classification, especially when the training data have an unbalanced representation of classes","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:33:28Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-27T14:06:03Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TADA","home":"https://bio.tools/TADA","summary":"phylogenetic augmentation of microbiome samples enhances phenotype classification | TADA is a new data augmentation technique for classifying phenotypes based on the microbiome.
