Two key selection criteria are (i) the predicted solubility and (ii) the sequence identities visualised using an interactive sequence similarity network. The search query can be a sequence from the Swiss-Prot database or a custom sequence with a custom description of essential residues. The output is an interactive selection table containing annotated identified sequences.","addition_date":"2020-05-14T05:43:26Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:22:58.362628Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["1.0"],"collections":["Czech Republic","ELIXIR-CZ"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EnzymeMiner","home":"https://bio.tools/enzymeminer","license":"Proprietary","version":"1.0","summary":"EnzymeMiner identifies putative members of enzyme families or subfamilies and facilitates the selection of promising targets for experimental characterization.
