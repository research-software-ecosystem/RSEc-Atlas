The tool takes as input a single variant call format (VCF) file and enables researchers to explore the impacts of analytical choices on the mutant allele frequency spectrum, on mutational signatures and on annotated somatic variants in genes of interest. It allows variants that have failed caller filters to be re-examined in order to improve sensitivity or guide strategies for optimal sample / sequencing preparation. It is extensible allowing other algorithms to take advantage of its VCF preprocessing capabilities.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:00:36Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-11T10:21:35Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"vcfView","home":"https://bio.tools/vcfview","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"An Extensible Data Visualization and Quality Assurance Platform for Integrated Somatic Variant Analysis.\n\nAn interactive Rshiny tool designed to support the evaluation of somatic mutation calls from cancer sequencing data.
