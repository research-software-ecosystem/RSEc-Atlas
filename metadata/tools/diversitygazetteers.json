It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. Each DWB module is devoted to a specific data domain. DG is used to manage and visualize geographical dictionary entries with information about places (particular regions and locations). In conjunction with an automatically created background map, equipped with world coordinates, collections of Microsoft SQL Geometry Objects (points, lines and areas) are displayed in their geographical context. Users with administrator rights may import places from other sources (e. g., ArcView shape files) or create places manually using the integrated Diversity GIS Editor. They may also organise the classification and naming of places.","addition_date":"2019-06-16T14:18:17Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DiversityGazetteers","home":"https://bio.tools/DiversityGazetteers","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"DiversityGazetteers  (DWB-DG) is an application of Diversity Workbench (DWB).
