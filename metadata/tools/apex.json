This technique uses machine learning algorithms to help correct for variable peptide detection related to certain peptide physicochemical properties which favor or hinder detection. A sample data set and descriptive tutorial help to acquaint users with the operation of the tool.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:16Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:17:07.451861Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.1.0"],"collections":["Proteomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"APEX","home":"https://bio.tools/apex","version":"1.1.0","summary":"Absolute protein expression Quantitative Proteomics Tool, is a free and open source Java implementation of the APEX technique for the quantitation of proteins based on standard LC- MS/MS proteomics data.
