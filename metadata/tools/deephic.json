We developed this server for helping researchers to enhance their own low-resolution data by a few steps of clicks. Ab initio training could be performed according to our published code. We provided trained models for various depth of low-coverage sequencing Hi-C data. The depth of input data is estimated by its distribution comparing with those of the downsampled Hi-C data we used in training.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:29:02Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-27T14:01:28Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DeepHiC","home":"https://bio.tools/deephic","license":"MIT","summary":"DeepHiC is a GAN-based model for enhancing Hi-C data resolution.
