It takes as input a plain DNA sequence and a pangenome which may either be a set of (multiple) FASTA or FASTQ files or a sequence graph constructed by the tool Bifrost. It then outputs statistically meaningful (gapped) alignments in the style of the NCBI BLAST standard output format. Alignments are calculated based on a \"seed-and-extend approach\" while traversing the sequence graph. Biologically meaningful alignments are filtered by using an alignment statistic explicitly developed for sequence-to-graph alignments involving graphical pangenomes.","addition_date":"2021-05-06T06:18:52Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:25:49.198791Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["0.0.1-0.2.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PLAST","home":"https://bio.tools/pangenome-blast","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"0.0.1-0.2.0","summary":"PLAST is a heuristical method to search for highest scoring local alignments between a DNA sequence query and a graphical pangenome.
