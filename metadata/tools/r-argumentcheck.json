{"tool_name":"r-argumentcheck","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-argumentcheck","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL-3","summary":"The typical process of checking arguments in functions is iterative.  In this process, an error may be returned and the user may fix it only to receive another error on a different argument.  'ArgumentCheck' facilitates a more helpful way to perform argument checks allowing the programmer to run all of the checks and then return all of the errors and warnings in a single message."}}}
