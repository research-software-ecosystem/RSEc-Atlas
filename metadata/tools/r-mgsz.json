{"tool_name":"r-mgsz","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-mgsz","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","summary":"Performs gene set analysis based on GSZ scoring function and asymptotic p-value. It is different from GSZ in that it implements asymptotic p-values instead of empirical p-values. Asymptotic p-values are calculated by fitting suitable distribution model to the null distribution. Unlike empirical p-values, resolution of asymptotic p-values are independent of the number of permutations and hence requires considerably fewer permutations. In addition, this package allows gene set analysis with seven other popular gene set analysis methods."}}}
