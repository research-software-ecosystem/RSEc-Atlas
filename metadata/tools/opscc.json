METHODS:Patients with OPSCC treated with primary radiotherapy at Rigshospitalet in the period 2010-2017 were included. All patients had a pretreatment FDG PET CT scan performed. Four cause-specific Cox regression models were built for the hazard ratios (HR) of recurrence in T-, N-, M-site, and death with no evidence of disease (NED), respectively. The following variables were included: T-, N-stage, p16 status, metabolic tumor volume, and FDG uptake in both primary tumor and lymph nodes.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:17:51Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T14:11:46Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OPSCC","home":"https://bio.tools/OPSCC","summary":"High nodal FDG uptake increases risk of distant metastasis in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nBACKGROUND:The purpose of this study was to investigate if FDG uptake metrics in primary tumor and lymph node metastases in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has a prognostic value beyond UICC8 staging in a multiple endpoint model.
