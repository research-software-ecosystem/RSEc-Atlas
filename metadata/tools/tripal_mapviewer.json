It facilitates development of biological websites by providing tools to integrate and display biological data using the generic database schema, Chado, together with Drupal, a popular website creation and content management system. Tripal MapViewer is a new interactive tool for visualizing genetic map data. Developed as a Tripal replacement for Comparative Map Viewer (CMap), it enables visualization of entire maps or linkage groups and features such as molecular markers, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and heritable phenotypic markers. It also provides graphical comparison of maps sharing the same markers as well as dot plot and correspondence matrices","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:15:46Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-31T11:27:43Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Tripal MapViewer","home":"https://bio.tools/Tripal_MapViewer","summary":"A tool for interactive visualization and comparison of genetic maps.\n\nTripal is an open-source, resource-efficient toolkit for construction of genomic, genetic and breeding databases.
