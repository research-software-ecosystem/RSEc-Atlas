The JUCHMME framework is ease of use and customization for various biological problems without requiring programming capabilities (settings will be made through a configuration file). It offers a large collection of training algorithms for HMM for labeled sequences. It integrates a wide range of decoding algorithms such as Viterbi, N\u2013Best, posterior\u2013Viterbi and Optimal Accuracy Posterior Decoder. It contains built-in evaluation procedures, such as options for independent test (self-consistency, jacknife, k\u2013fold cross-validation). All the prediction algorithms also incorporate the corresponding reliability measures. To overcome HMM limitations, a number of extensions have been developed such as Hidden Neural Networks, models that condition on previous observations and a method for semi-supervised learning.","addition_date":"2020-05-07T14:12:21Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:59:04.986794Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0.5"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"JUCHMME","home":"https://bio.tools/juchmme","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"1.0.5","summary":"JUCHMME, an acronym for Java Utility for Class Hidden Markov Models and Extensions is a tool developed for biological sequence analysis.
