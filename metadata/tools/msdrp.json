However, it's still a challenging task to accurately predict drug responses in cancer cell lines. In this study, we presented a novel computational approach, named as MSDRP (modular within and between score for drug response prediction), to predict drug responses in cell lines. The method is based on a constructed heterogeneous drug-cell line network with multiple information. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, MSDRP acquired better predictive performance, and identified potential associations between drugs and cell lines, which have been confirmed by the published literature.
