By concretely describing the molecular structure of biopolymers, BpForms aims to help epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, systems biology, and synthetic biology researchers share and integrate information about DNA modification, post-transcriptional modification, post-translational modification, expanded genetic codes, and synthetic parts. In particular, BpForms was developed to help researchers collaboratively develop whole-cell computational models.","addition_date":"2020-05-22T17:01:35Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:35:19.564502Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library","Web API","Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BpForms","home":"https://bio.tools/bpforms","license":"MIT","summary":"BpForms is a toolkit for unambiguously describing the molecular structure (atoms and bonds) of DNA, RNA, and proteins, including non-canonical monomeric forms (subunits which compose polymers), crosslinks, nicks, and circular topologies.
