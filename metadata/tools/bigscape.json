BiG-SCAPE does this by rapidly calculating a distance matrix between gene clusters based on a comparison of their protein domain content, order, copy number and sequence identity.It defines a distance metric between Gene Clusters using a combination of three indices (Jaccard Index of domain types, Domain Sequence Similarity the Adjacency...BiG-SCAPE and CORASON provide a set of tools to explore the diversity of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across large numbers of genomes, by constructing BGC sequence similarity networks, grouping BGCs into gene cluster families, and exploring gene cluster diversity linked to enzyme phylogenies.","bio_tools_ids":"BiG-SCAPE","bio_tools_name":"BiG-SCAPE","related_tutorials":[],"related_workflows":[],"tool_ids":["bigscape"],"no_of_tools":{"eu":1,"org":0,"org.au":0,"be":0,"cz":0,"fr":0,"no":0}}}}
