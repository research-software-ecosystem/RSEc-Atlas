It organises the variant data by grouping each variant based on the laws of Mendelian inheritance. Taking three Variant Call Format files as input, the tool provides a user interface to test different coverage thresholds, to find the optimal threshold values, and to gain insights into the global effects of filtering.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:13:51Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["20130409"]}}}
