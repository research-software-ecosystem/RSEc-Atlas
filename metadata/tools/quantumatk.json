While different aspects and individual modules of the platform have been previously presented, the purpose of this paper is to give a general overview of the platform. The QuantumATK simulation engines enable electronic-structure calculations using density functional theory or tight-binding model Hamiltonians, and also offers bonded or reactive empirical force fields in many different parametrizations. Density functional theory is implemented using either a plane-wave basis or expansion of electronic states in a linear combination of atomic orbitals","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:27:58Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-11T15:07:22Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"QuantumATK","home":"https://bio.tools/QuantumATK","summary":"an integrated platform of electronic and atomic-scale modelling tools | QuantumATK is an integrated set of atomic-scale modelling tools developed since 2003 by professional software engineers in collaboration with academic researchers.
