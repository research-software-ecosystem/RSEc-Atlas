The workflow of WgLink is briefed as follows: (A) WgLink first determines local haplotypes in tiling genomic windows by applying other tools: TenSQR or aBayesQR. (B) Regional haplotypes are then stitched together to generate all possible whole-genome haplotypes using a breadth-first search which could tolerate specified SNV mismatch when extending regions. (C) The final non-zero haplotype frequencies are estimated by L0L1 regularized regression.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:22:50Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-14T11:46:02Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"WgLink","home":"https://bio.tools/wglink","summary":"reconstructing whole-genome viral haplotypes using L0 + L1-regularization.\n\nWgLink is a novel tool using regularized regression to stitch together regional haplotypes into global ones.
