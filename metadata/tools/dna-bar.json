Selected distinguishers satisfy user specified bounds on length, melting temperature and GC content, as well as redundancy and cross-hybridization constraints.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:05:38Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DNA-BAR","home":"https://bio.tools/dna-bar","summary":"DNA-BAR is a software package for selecting DNA probes (henceforth referred to as distinguishers) that can be used in genomic-based identification of microorganisms.
