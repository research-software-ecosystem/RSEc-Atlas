Shape abstraction integrates well with dynamic programming algorithms, and hence it can be applied during structure prediction rather than afterwards. This avoids exponential explosion and can still give us a nonheuristic and complete account of properties of the molecules folding space."},"biotools":{"id":"rnashapes","home":"http://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnashapes","summary":"Integration of tools for RNA abstract shape analysis.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:11:54Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:19:38.590977Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["3.3.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RNAshapes","home":"https://bio.tools/rnashapes","version":"3.3.0","summary":"Integration of tools for RNA abstract shape analysis.","tool_type":"sc:SoftwareApplication"}}}
