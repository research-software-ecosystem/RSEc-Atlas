BetweenNet utilizes a measure based on betweenness centrality on patient specific networks to identify the so-called outlier genes that correspond to dysregulated genes for each patient. Setting up the relationship between the mutated genes and the outliers through a bipartite graph, it employs a random-walk process on the graph, which provides the final prioritization of the mutated genes.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:18:09Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-11T13:01:40Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"BetweenNet","home":"https://bio.tools/betweennet","summary":"BetweenNet is a computational approach that integrates genomic data with a protein-protein interaction network to identify cancer driver genes.
