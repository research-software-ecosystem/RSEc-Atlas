Rearrangements, breakpoints, and synteny blocks are identified along the focal genome and output in a tabular format. Rearrangements and synteny blocks can be visualized along the focal genome by two graphical functions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:35:19Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-04T15:32:20Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"rearrvisr","home":"https://bio.tools/rearrvisr","summary":"The R package rearrvisr provides functions to identify and visualize inter- and intrachromosomal translocations and inversions between a focal genome and an ancestral genome reconstruction, or two extant genomes.
