MACPET reads ChIA-PET data in BAM or SAM format and separates the data into Self-ligated, Intra- and Inter-chromosomal PETs. Furthermore, MACPET breaks the genome into regions and applies 2D mixture models for identifying candidate peaks/binding sites using skewed generalized students-t distributions (SGT). It then uses a local poisson model for finding significant binding sites.","addition_date":"2018-07-11T12:25:21Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MACPET","home":"https://bio.tools/macpet","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"1.0.0","summary":"It can be used for binding site analysis for ChIA-PET data.
