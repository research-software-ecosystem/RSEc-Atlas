The algorithm transforms one distribution into another, providing the overall difference in shape between two distributions.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T14:55:37Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:27:42.934782Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["2.4.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EMDomics","home":"https://bio.tools/emdomics","license":"MIT","version":"2.4.0","summary":"Algorithm used to perform a supervised multi-class analysis to measure the magnitude and statistical significance of observed continuous genomics data between groups.
