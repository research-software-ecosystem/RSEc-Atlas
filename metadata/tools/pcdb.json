For each protein, the database contains the redundant compilation of all the corresponding crystallographic structures obtained under different conditions. These structures could be considered as different instances of protein dynamism. As a measure of the conformational diversity we use the maximum RMSD obtained comparing the structures deposited for each domain. The redundant structures were extracted following CATH classification and cross linked.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T08:35:13Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:50Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
