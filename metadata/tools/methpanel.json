The tool covers a complete analysis workflow from genomic alignment to DNA methylation calling and supports an unlimited number of PCR amplicons and input samples. Moreover MethPanel offers important and unique features, such as a epipolymorphism score and a bisulphite PCR bias correction. MethPanel can be run in parallel by samples on either a personal computer or a high performance computer. The outputs are automatically forwarded to a shinyApp for convenient display, visualisation and sharing of data with collaborators and clinicians.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:29:42Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-22T08:22:33Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MethPanel","home":"https://bio.tools/methpanel","summary":"A parallel pipeline and interactive analysis tool for multiplex bisulphite PCR sequencing to assess DNA methylation biomarker panels for disease detection.\n\nMethPanel is a computational pipeline in Linux operating system with an interactive graphical interface for rapid analysis of multiplex bisulphite PCR sequencing data.
