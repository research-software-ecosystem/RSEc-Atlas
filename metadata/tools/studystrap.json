Ensembling models trained on individual studies has been shown to improve replicability in new studies. Motivated by a groundbreaking new technology in human neuroscience, we introduce two generalizations of multi-study ensemble predictions. First, while existing methods weight ensemble elements by cross-study prediction performance, we extend weighting schemes to also incorporate covariate similarity between training data and target validation studies. Second, we introduce a hierarchical resampling scheme to generate pseudo-study replicates (\u201cstudy straps\u201d) and ensemble classifiers trained on these rather than the original studies themselves. We demonstrate analytically that existing methods are special cases","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:32:35Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-27T11:43:05Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"studyStrap","home":"https://bio.tools/studyStrap","summary":"Covariate-Profile Similarity Weighting and Bagging Studies with the Study Strap.\n\nPrediction settings with multiple studies have become increasingly common.
