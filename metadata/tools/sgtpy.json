SGTPy allows to work with pure fluids and fluid mixtures, additionally the fluids can be modeled considering association, cross-association and polar contributions. SGTPy was built on top of phasepy's phase equilibrium and Square Gradient Theory (SGT) functions. These functions were updated to speed-up calculations of associative mixtures.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:56:31Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-08T12:56:27Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SGTPy","home":"https://bio.tools/sgtpy","summary":"A Python Code for Calculating the Interfacial Properties of Fluids Based on the Square Gradient Theory Using the SAFT-VR Mie Equation of State.\n\nSGTPy is an open-source python package of SAFT-VR-Mie Equation of State (EOS).
