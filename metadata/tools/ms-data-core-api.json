The Application Programming Interface, written in Java, enables rapid tool creation by providing a robust, pluggable programming interface and common data model. The data model is based on controlled vocabularies/ontologies and captures the whole range of data types included in common proteomics experimental workflows, going from spectra to peptide/protein identifications to quantitative results. The library contains readers for three of the most used Proteomics Standards Initiative standard file formats: mzML, mzIdentML, and mzTab. In addition to mzML, it also supports other common mass spectra data formats: dta, ms2, mgf, pkl, apl (text-based), mzXML and mzData (XML-based). Also, it can be used to read PRIDE XML, the original format used by the PRIDE database, one of the world-leading proteomics resources.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:49:05Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["2.0.31"],"collections":["Proteomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ms-data-core-api","home":"https://bio.tools/ms-data-core-api","license":"Apache-2.0","version":"2.0.31","summary":"The ms-data-core-api is a free, open-source library for developing computational proteomics tools and pipelines.
