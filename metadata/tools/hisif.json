Standalone CERN ROOT C++ framework is used to extract fit parameters of the CTS interactions. A small C tool is provided to process the initial data from NCBI. HiSIF supports all of the available three Hi-C protocols (Hi-C, TCC and in situ Hi-C). The tool is named from the fact that it is designed to find the significant interactions from a given sample of Hi-C reads.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:25:24Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-30T11:43:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HiSIF","home":"https://bio.tools/hisif","summary":"Modeling and analysis of Hi-C data by HiSIF identifies characteristic promoter-distal loops.\n\nHiSIF - HiC Significant Interacting Fragments.\n\nHiSIF was implemented by using C++/C with parallel processing being written in C.
