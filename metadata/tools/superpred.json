Such information can be useful in drug classification and target prediction.","addition_date":"2017-03-24T14:34:07Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:51:38.047863Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SuperPred","home":"https://bio.tools/superpred","summary":"The SuperPred web server compares the structural fingerprint of an input molecule to a database of drugs connected to their drug targets and affected pathways.
