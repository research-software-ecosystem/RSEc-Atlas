The perturbations supported on regions are shift, drop, add, cut, and merge. This tool is particularly useful for creating test datasets for various tasks, since there often is no ground truth dataset to compare to. By perturbing a file, a pipeline or analysis can be run on both the perturbed file and the original file, then be compared.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:00:20Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-31T17:24:05Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"bedshift","home":"https://bio.tools/bedshift","license":"BSD-Source-Code","summary":"Bedshift is a tool for randomly perturbing BED file regions.
