It provides a pipeline to detect specific interactions between DNA elements and identify differential interactions between conditions. The statistical analysis in R starts with individual bam files for each sample as inputs. To obtain these files, the package contains a python script to demultiplex libraries and trim off primer sequences. With a standard alignment software the required bam files can be then be generated.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T14:55:44Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-11T00:57:00Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.8.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FourCSeq","home":"https://bio.tools/fourcseq","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"1.8.0","summary":"R package dedicated to the analysis of (multiplexed) 4C sequencing data.
