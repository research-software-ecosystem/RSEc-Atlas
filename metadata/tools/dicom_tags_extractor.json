Two execution modes are available : manual execution and command line execution.\nFor the tool to scan data successfully, it is important that : 1/ the extension \u201c.dcm\u201d is visible, as the tool only scans those files, and discard any other; 2/ each DICOM series has its own folder, as the tool gets a single .dcm file from each folder and extracts the tags.","addition_date":"2025-04-18T15:04:18.411979Z","last_update_date":"2025-06-04T11:29:09.107990Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["EUCAIM"]}}}
