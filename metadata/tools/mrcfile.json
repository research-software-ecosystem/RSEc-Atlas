The code runs in Python 2 and 3 and is fully unit-tested.\n\nThis library aims to allow users and developers to read and write standard-compliant MRC files in Python as easily as possible, and with no dependencies on any compiled libraries except numpy. You can use it interactively to inspect files, correct headers and so on, or in scripts and larger software packages to provide basic MRC file I/O functions.","addition_date":"2019-06-05T15:40:09Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:24Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.1.x"],"collections":["Instruct"]}}}
