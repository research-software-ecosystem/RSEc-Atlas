Implements the variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR) procedure, as well as SKAT, Burden, and ACAT tests for both continuous and dichotomous traits. The STAAR method incorporates qualitative functional categories and quantitative complementary functional annotations (Li and Li et al, 2020). The workflow accounts for population structure and relatedness, and scales for large whole genome sequencing studies.","addition_date":"2022-01-25T00:32:00.559399Z","last_update_date":"2022-01-25T00:32:00.561700Z","tool_type":["Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"STAAR workflow","home":"https://bio.tools/staar_workflow","license":"MIT","summary":"Workflow to perform aggregate rare variant tests for sequencing studies and genetic data.
