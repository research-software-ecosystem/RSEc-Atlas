The file will contain the genotype data at over 0.5 million SNP sites previously identified by the 1000 Genomes project. Such a file can then be used as a data source for a mapping program designed for analyzing Affymetrix microarray SNP data.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:28Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["20130204"]}}}
