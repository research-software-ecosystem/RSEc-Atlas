However, the computation of the long sequencing reads is challenged by their higher error rates (e.g., 13% vs. 1%) and higher cost ($0.3 vs. $0.03 per Mbp) compared to the short reads. METHODS:In this paper, we present a new hybrid error correction tool, called ParLECH (Parallel Long-read Error Correction using Hybrid methodology). The error correction algorithm of ParLECH is distributed in nature and efficiently utilizes the k-mer coverage information of high throughput Illumina short-read sequences to rectify the PacBio long-read sequences.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:05:06Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-05T09:18:43Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ParLECH","home":"https://bio.tools/ParLECH","summary":"A hybrid and scalable error correction algorithm for indel and substitution errors of long reads.\n\nBACKGROUND:Long-read sequencing has shown the promises to overcome the short length limitations of second-generation sequencing by providing more complete assembly.
