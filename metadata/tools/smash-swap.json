SMaSH helps detect such sample swaps by integrating the information from over 6000 carefully selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites from across the human genome to identify which samples in a group of sequencing data sets are derived from the same human individual. Importantly, SMaSH is able to verify sample identity between different data types, such as RNA-Seq, exome, and MethylCap-Seq data.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:10:20Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T16:10:13Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SMASH","home":"https://bio.tools/smash-swap","summary":"Sample matching using SNPs in humans.\n\nA tool for sample swap identification in high throughput sequencing studies.\n\nSample swaps are a real concern in high throughput sequencing studies.
