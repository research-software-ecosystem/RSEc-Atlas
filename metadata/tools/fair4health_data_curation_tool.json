The tool is used to connect the health data sources which can be in various formats (Excel files, CSV files, SQL databases) and migrate data into a HL7 FHIR Repository. The tool shows the available FHIR profiles to the user so that he/she can perform mappings appropriately. The tool can also contact a Terminology Server (which is actually another HL7 FHIR Repository) so that data fields can be annotated if coding schemes such as ICD10 or SNOMED-CT are in use.","addition_date":"2022-03-28T13:40:03.295193Z","last_update_date":"2023-06-22T13:27:59.601392Z","version":["v1.2.5"],"collections":["EUCAIM","IMPaCT-Data"]}}}
