It is designed to enable discovery by connecting to the thought processes of biological researchers in a way that allows them to search results from an initial GWAS (or other association study), ask follow-up questions, and get answers in real-time. OASIS accomplishes this with a web-based search system and a variety of real-time analysis tools including conditional & multi-covariate analysis, and real-time linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculations. On-demand visualizations are provided in the form of boxplots, histograms, LocusZoom & Haploview plots. The OASIS search reports contain a broad spectrum of annotation from Annovar and WGSA plus a variety of links to external resources such as gnomAD, GTEx, HaploReg, Roadmap, UCSC and NCBI.","addition_date":"2021-10-25T08:23:20.623901Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-25T08:23:20.626539Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OASIS","home":"https://bio.tools/oasis-omics","summary":"OASIS (Omics Analysis, Search & Information System) is an information system for analyzing, searching, and visualizing associations between phenotypes, genotypes, and other types of omics data (such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc.).
