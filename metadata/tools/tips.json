The structural details of the drug mode of binding are also provided. Predictions are made using the information coming from drug-target three-dimensional complexes and by exploiting the homology relationships of known drug targets with pathogen proteins. Predicted pathogen targets are further annotated with sequence, structural and functional information.","addition_date":"2015-01-22T11:49:00Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:56:25.310043Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TiPs","home":"https://bio.tools/tips","summary":"This database collects predicted drug targets in 150 pathogen species.
