The sub-network comprising such paths, referred to as the TopNet, captures the most relevant genes and processes underlying the specific biological context. The TopNet forms a well-connected graph, reflecting the tight orchestration in biological systems. Two key advantages of PathExt are (i) it can extract characteristic genes and pathways even when only a single sample is available, and (ii) it can be used to study a system even in the absence of an appropriate control.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T06:57:43Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-22T18:11:01Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PathExt","home":"https://bio.tools/pathext","summary":"PathExt is a general framework for path-based mining of omics-integrated biological networks.\n\nWe provide a computational tool - PathExt, which identifies differentially active paths when a control is available, and most active paths otherwise, in an omics-integrated biological network.
