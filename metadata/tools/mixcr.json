MiXCR efficiently handles paired- and single-end reads, considers sequence quality, corrects PCR errors and identifies germline hypermutations. The software supports both partial- and full-length profiling and employs all available RNA or DNA information, including sequences upstream of V and downstream of J gene segments."},"biotools":{"id":"MiXCR","home":"https://milaboratory.com/software/mixcr/","license":"Other","summary":"Software for extraction of T- and B-cell receptor repertoires from any type of sequencing data.","addition_date":"2019-06-18T14:17:04Z","last_update_date":"2019-07-29T14:00:45Z","tool_type":["Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MiXCR","home":"https://bio.tools/MiXCR","license":"Other","summary":"Software for extraction of T- and B-cell receptor repertoires from any type of sequencing data.","tool_type":"sc:SoftwareApplication"}}}
