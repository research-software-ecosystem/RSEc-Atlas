However, for some of these models, the computation of maximum likelihood estimators is quite difficult due to presence of flat regions in the search space, among other factors. Several well-known derivative-based optimization tools are unsuitable for obtaining such estimates. To circumvent this problem, we introduce the AdequacyModel computational library version 2.0.0 for the R statistical environment with two major contributions: a general optimization technique based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method (with a minor modification of the original algorithm) and a set of statistical measures for assessment of the adequacy of the fitted model","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:26:47Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-01T14:58:40Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"AdequacyModel","home":"https://bio.tools/AdequacyModel","summary":"An R package for probability distributions and general purpose optimization | Several lifetime distributions have played an important role to fit survival data.
