The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and these methods fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications. Here, we present MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:07:32Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:52:34.604958Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MetaMiner","home":"https://bio.tools/MetaMiner","summary":"A Scalable Peptidogenomics Approach for Discovery of Ribosomal Peptide Natural Products with Blind Modifications from Microbial Communities.\n\nRibosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an important class of natural products that contain antibiotics and a variety of other bioactive compounds.
