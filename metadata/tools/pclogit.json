The algorithm is efficient for fitting the regularization path and for providing selection probabilities of each predictor for the anaylsis of high-dimensional matched/unmatched case-control data. It uses cyclical coordinate descent in a pathwise fashion.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:15:22Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["0.1"]}}}
