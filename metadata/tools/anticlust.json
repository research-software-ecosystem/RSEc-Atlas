This is accomplished by maximizing instead of minimizing a clustering objective function, such as the intra-cluster variance (used in k-means clustering) or the sum of pairwise distances within clusters. Thus, anticlustering creates similar sets of elements by maximizing heterogeneity within anticlusters.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:36:45Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-23T16:29:53Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"anticlust","home":"https://bio.tools/anticlust","license":"MIT","summary":"Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into subsets (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as similar as possible.
