It can be applied independent of the assignment complexity, it does not require tight thresholds for establishing sequential connectivity or detailed adjustment of these thresholds, it can work with a wide variety of NMR experiments and it is robust against missing chemical shift information. In case of a known 3D structure, residual dipolar couplings can be used to enhance assignment.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:48:52Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T16:12:44.628317Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MARS","home":"https://bio.tools/mars","summary":"Program for robust automatic backbone assignment of 13C/15N labeled proteins.
