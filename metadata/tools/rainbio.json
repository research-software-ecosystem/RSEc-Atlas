RainBio can perform the exact proportional visualization of up to 6 sets, and support intersection clustering, allowing to visualize up to 15 sets.\n\nRainBio uses the same file format that InteractiVenn. Several demo datasets are available on the website.","addition_date":"2019-07-29T12:34:35Z","last_update_date":"2019-08-01T11:36:06Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RainBio","home":"https://bio.tools/RainBio","license":"LGPL-3.0","summary":"RainBio is a visual tool for comparing gene sets or protein sets, in a proportional way.\n\nRainBio is an alternative to the classical Venn diagrams and Euler diagrams.
