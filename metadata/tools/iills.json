The receptor-binding is the first step for the viral infection of hosts. To more effectively treat human viral infectious diseases, the hidden virus-receptor interactions must be discovered. However, current computational methods for predicting virus-receptor interactions are limited. RESULT:In this study, we propose a new computational method (IILLS) to predict virus-receptor interactions based on Initial Interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square algorithm. IILLS integrates the known virus-receptor interactions and amino acid sequences of receptors. The similarity of viruses is calculated by the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel. On the other hand, we also compute the receptor GIP similarity and the receptor sequence similarity.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:35:34Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-14T08:48:39Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IILLS","home":"https://bio.tools/IILLS","summary":"Predicting virus-receptor interactions based on similarity and semi-supervised learning.\n\nBACKGROUND:Viral infectious diseases are the serious threat for human health.
