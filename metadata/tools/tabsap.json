It's main features are:\n\n-Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step\n\n-Supports single-end read alignments\n\n-Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable\n\n-The output gives heatmap with categories.","addition_date":"2019-12-03T09:45:17Z","last_update_date":"2019-12-03T09:49:45Z","version":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2"]}}}
