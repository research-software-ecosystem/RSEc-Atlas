ChemStor borrows concepts from formal methods - a branch of computer science capable of mathematically proving a specification or software is correct - to safely store or dispose of chemicals. If two or more chemicals can be combined in the same cabinet without forming possibly dangerous combinations of chemicals (while observing cabinet/shelf space constraints), then ChemStor determines that the storage configuration is safe.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:04:22Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T15:27:51Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ChemStor","home":"https://bio.tools/chemstor","summary":"ChemStor is an open-source, automated computational system that can guarantee (mathematically verify a system is correct with respect to its specification), with regard to prescribed constraints, safe storage and disposal of chemicals used in academic, industrial, and domestic settings.
