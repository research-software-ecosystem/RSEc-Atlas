It has similar functionality as DNACopy (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004), but is considerably faster and more flexible. It can segment data from DNA microarrays and data from next generation sequencing for example to detect copy number segments. Further it can segment data from RNA microarrays like tiling arrays to identify transcripts. Most generally, it can segment data given as a matrix or as a vector.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:00:14Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-30T16:46:22Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.20.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"fastseg","home":"https://bio.tools/fastseg","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.20.0","summary":"Implements a very fast and efficient segmentation algorithm.
