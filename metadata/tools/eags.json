{"tool_name":"eags","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"EAGS","home":"https://github.com/STOmics/EAGS","summary":"EAGS is a smoothing approach for spatial transcriptome data with ultrahigh resolution. Through the principal component information of the profiling of gene expression and the personally identifiable information between cells, it uses a two-factor adaptive smoothing weight mechanism to determine the neighborhood relationship of cells. Then it uses the self-developed smoothing weight formula to calculate the smoothing contribution and recalculate the gene expression of each cell.","addition_date":"2023-09-05T12:59:35.939430Z","last_update_date":"2023-09-05T12:59:57.572934Z"}}}
