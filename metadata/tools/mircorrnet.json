This tool allows you to make an integrated mRNA - miRNA profiles analysis. Via using this document you can easily execute the steps and you can obtain the results. Using this document you can easily repeat the experiments. miRcorrNet uses 2 different data sheets with same control-case column. It means you should have same samples in one column which should be both in mRNA and miRNA data sheet. In this study we used KNIME analytics platform. Therefore, the data is stored in \".table\" extension files.","addition_date":"2021-10-10T14:49:47.448637Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-10T14:49:47.451100Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"miRcorrNet","home":"https://bio.tools/mircorrnet","license":"MIT","summary":"miRcorrNet is a machine learning-based integration of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, combined with feature grouping and ranking.
