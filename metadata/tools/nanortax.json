It combines state-of-the-art classifiers such as Kraken2, Centrifuge and BLAST with downstream analysis steps to provide a framework for the analysis of in-progress sequencing runs. NanoRTax retrieves the final output files in the same structure/format for every classifier which enables more comprehensive tool/database comparison and better benchmarking capabilities. Additionally, NanoRTax includes a web application (./viz_webapp/) for visualizing complete or partial pipeline outputs.\n\nThe NanoRTax pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner.
