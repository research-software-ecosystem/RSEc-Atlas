Leveraging on the user-friendliness of the Colab interface, LSTrAP-Cloud allows users to analyse large scale transcriptome data without having to access the linux terminal, making it accessible to both bioinformaticians and biologist. To get started, we have provided a tutorial based on example data found here. While the pipeline was designed for plants, we have also made the script compatible with non-plant organisms.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:05:22Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T08:04:07Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LSTrAP-Cloud","home":"https://bio.tools/lstrap-cloud","summary":"A User-friendly Cloud Computing Pipeline to Infer Co-functional and Regulatory Networks.\n\nLarge-Scale Transcriptome Analysis Pipeline on Cloud.\n\nIf you use LSTrAP-Cloud in your research, please cite:.\n\nThis repository is built upon wirriamm/CoNeGC.\n\nLSTrAP-Cloud is a pipeline designed for building co-expression networks from RNA-seq data (fastq files from ENA) on Goolge Colaboratory (Colab).
