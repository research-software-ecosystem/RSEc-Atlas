BnpC employs a Chinese Restaurant Process prior to handle the unknown number of clonal populations. The model introduces a combination of Gibbs sampling, a modified non-conjugate split-merge move and Metropolis-Hastings updates to explore the joint posterior space of all parameters. Furthermore, it employs a novel estimator, which accounts for the shape of the posterior distribution, to predict the clones and genotypes.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:00:21Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-04T16:43:55Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BnpC","home":"https://bio.tools/bnpc","license":"MIT","summary":"BnpC is a non-parametric method to cluster individual cells into clones and infer their genotypes based on their noisy mutation profiles.
