OMSSA scores significant hits with a probability score developed using classical hypothesis testing, the same statistical method used in BLAST. It is developed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.","addition_date":"2019-02-20T16:17:02Z","last_update_date":"2019-09-04T08:38:55Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["Proteomics","ms-utils"]}}}
