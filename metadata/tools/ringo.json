Its main functionalities are data read-in, quality assessment, data visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip. It has functions to deal with two-color nucleotide microarrays from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains more general functions for ChIP-chip data analysis, given that the data is supplied as RGList or ExpressionSet. It employs functions from various other packages.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:01:39Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-24T21:58:19Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.38.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Ringo","home":"https://bio.tools/ringo","license":"Artistic-2.0","version":"1.38.0","summary":"The package facilitates primary analysis of ChIP-chip data.
