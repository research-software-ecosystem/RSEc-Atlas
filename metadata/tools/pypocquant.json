In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, they offer rapid on-site diagnostics and can relieve centralized laboratory testing sites, thus freeing resources that can be focused on especially vulnerable groups. However, visual interpretation of the POCT test lines is subjective, error prone and only qualitative.
