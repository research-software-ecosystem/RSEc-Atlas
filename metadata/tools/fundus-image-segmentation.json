The Kirsch's template is used for tracking the larger blood vessels; fuzzy c-means is used to segment smaller blood vessels. The region based active contour method is used for edge detection and Morphoplogical operations are used to remove the background from the foreground fundus image. This methodology is suitable for different fundus image databases captured using different fundus cameras.","addition_date":"2021-05-05T11:09:52Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-23T11:52:38Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.0.0.0"],"collections":["File Exchange","MATLAB"]}}}
