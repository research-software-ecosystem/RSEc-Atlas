Its extension mechanism makes the software adaptable for a wide range of digital X-ray imaging hardware combinations and provides capabilities for researchers to develop image processing plug-ins. Independent of the X-ray sensor technology, iBEX could integrate with heterogeneous communication channels of digital detectors. iBEX is a freeware option for preclinical and early clinical testing of radiography devices.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:51:00Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:55:55.300989Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iBEX","home":"https://bio.tools/iBEX","summary":"Modular Open-Source Software for Digital Radiography.\n\nA device-independent software package, named iBEX, is developed to accelerate the research and development efforts for X-ray imaging setups such as chest radiography, linear and multidirectional tomography, and dental and skeletal radiography.
