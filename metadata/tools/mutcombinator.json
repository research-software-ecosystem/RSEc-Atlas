It uses an upgraded version of a variant graph, keeping track of frame information. The variant graph is indexed by nine nucleotides for fast access. Combinations of point mutations are considered, and also it can be practically applied together with a large mutation database such as COSMIC.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:01:01Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-02T08:30:55Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MutCombinator","home":"https://bio.tools/mutcombinator","summary":"Identification of mutated peptides allowing combinatorial mutations using nucleotide-based graph search.\n\nMutCombinator - Combinatorial mutation search.\n\nMutCombinator enables us to practically identify mutated peptides from tandem mass spectra allowing combinatorial mutations during the database search.
