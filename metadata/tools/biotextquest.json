BTQ collects abstracts from Medline literature and OMIM databases matching a user query. Identification of relevant terms enables the representation of text records in a Vector Space Model and the calculation of pairwise document similarities. Employing suitable clustering algorithms, results are transformed into clusters of records along with their corresponding terms.","addition_date":"2017-09-19T13:22:48Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BioTextQuest+","home":"https://bio.tools/biotextquest","summary":"Implements an enhanced version of the TextQuest algorithm, providing a user friendly web-based interface.
