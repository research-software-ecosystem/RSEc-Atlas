Many in the circadian biology community use the FFT NLLS suite of programs, to estimate period and phase values from rhythmic experimental data. A user interface is developed to act as a front end to these programs. It imports data from most of the data acquisition packages commonly used in plant circadian research, and from a generic block of data. Then it runs FFT-NLLS on this data, and import the results into MS Excel.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:04:27Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["3.0"]}}}
