It provides performant, rapid query speeds for cloud computation on genome assemblies. It enable fuzzy as well as exact k-mer-based searches of assemblies. To enable robust and speedy performance, the website implements cache-friendly hash tables, memory mapping and massive parallel processing. Our method employs a scalable and efficient data structure that can be used to jointly index and search a large collection of human genome assembly information. One can include variant databases and their associated metadata such as the gnomAD population variant catalog. This feature enables the incorporation of future genomic information into sequencing analysis.","addition_date":"2021-10-04T10:12:14.127679Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-04T10:12:14.130143Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"KmerKeys","home":"https://bio.tools/kmerkeys","summary":"KmerKeys is a web resource for searching indexed genome assemblies and variants.
