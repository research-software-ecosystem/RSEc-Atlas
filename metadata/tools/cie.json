CIE provides a user-friendly web-app and an R-package to run inference queries on casual regulatory netowrks. Several regulatory networks are provided in the platform, including a TF-gene intraction network constructed from ChIP-seq and tissue specific gene expression data, a netowrk based on STRING-DB, and curated TF-gene interaction networks such as TRRUST and TRED. The R-package provides functionality for custom networks as well.\n\nCausal Inference Engine: Directional Enrichment Analysis on Biological Networks.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:42:27Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:55:41.511160Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Causal Inference Enrichment (CIE)","home":"https://bio.tools/CIE","summary":"a platform for directional gene set enrichment analysis and inference of active transcriptional regulators.\n\nCausal Inference and Directional Enrichment Methods on Biological Networks.\n\nLaunching Causal Inference Engine...\n\nCIE is a platform for inference of active transcriptional regulators of differential gene expression.
