In Mal-Prec, three encoding method including One-hot encoding, physiochemical properties (AAindex), and composition of k-spaced acid pairs (CKSAAP) were initially performed to extract sequence features. PCA was then applied to select optimal feature subsets while SVM was adopted to predict the malonylation sites. Five-fold cross-validation test and independent test results showed that Mal-Prec can achieve better prediction performance compared with other approaches.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:54:21Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T09:16:10Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Mal-Prec","home":"https://bio.tools/mal-prec","summary":"Computational prediction of protein Malonylation sites via machine learning based feature integration.\n\nMal-Prec is a supervised machine learning classification to predict malonylated sites.
