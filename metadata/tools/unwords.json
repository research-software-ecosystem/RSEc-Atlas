It is more efficient than previous algorithms and easier to use. It uses bit vector encoding of strings and therefore we called it unwords-bits. It directly computes unwords without the need to specify a length estimate. Moreover, it avoids the space requirements of index structures such as suffix trees and suffix arrays.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:13:56Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:32:23.463828Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"UNWORDS","home":"https://bio.tools/unwords","summary":"An efficient software for computing shortest strings which do not occur in a given set of DNA sequences.
