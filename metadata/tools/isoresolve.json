IsoResolve treats gene- level and isoform-level features as source and target domain, respectively. It employs DA to project the two domains to a latent variable (LV) space in such a way that the LVs projected from the gene and isoform domain features are of approximately the same distribution, enabling that the gene domain information can be leveraged for predicting isoform functions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:54:21Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:44:31.442605Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IsoResolve","home":"https://bio.tools/isoresolve","summary":"Predicting Splice Isoform Functions by Integrating Gene and Isoform-level Features with Domain Adaptation.\n\nIsoResolve is a computational approach for isoform function prediction by leveraging the information of gene function prediction models with domain adaptation (DA).
