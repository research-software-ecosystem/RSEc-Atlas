The framework is based on optimizing an objective function that maximizes clone structure coherence between single-cell gene expression and copy number profiles, in which the two profiles are copuled by the dosage effect. The coupling dosage effect can be estimated a prior either by a linear regression model using publicly aviable paired RNA and DNA bulk sequencing data (TCGA), or by using an uninformative prior. The workflow in CCNMF is illustrated in the figure below.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:39:28Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-09T08:04:27Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CCNMF","home":"https://bio.tools/ccnmf","license":"MIT","summary":"Coupled-Clone Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CCNMF) is a method for joint inference of clonal structure using paired Single-cell DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data.
