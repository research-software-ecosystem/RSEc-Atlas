The underlying principle used is that residue-residue contacts are denser within a domain than between domains. We have formulated the domain decomposition problem as a network flow problem, in which each residue is represented as a node of a network and each residue-residue contact is represented as an edge with a particular capacity, depending on the type of the contact.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:05:53Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-14T09:53:39Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DomainParser","home":"https://bio.tools/domainparser","version":"2","summary":"DomainParser uses a new algorithm for the decomposition of a multi-domain protein into individual structural domains.
