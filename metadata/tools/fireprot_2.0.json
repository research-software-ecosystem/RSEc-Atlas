FireProt constructs stable mutants using both structural and evolutionary information. FireProt 2.0 also integrates the AlphaFold database and the homology modelling for structure prediction, enabling calculations starting from a sequence. Multiple-point designs are constructed using the Bron\u2013Kerbosch algorithm minimizing the antagonistic effect between the individual mutations. Users can newly limit the FireProt calculation to a set of user-defined mutations, run saturation mutagenesis of the whole protein or select rigidifying mutations based on B-factors. Evolution-based back-to-consensus strategy is complemented by ancestral sequence reconstruction.","addition_date":"2023-12-08T08:58:13.450577Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:28:54.237913Z","tool_type":["Web service"],"version":["2.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FireProt 2.0","home":"https://bio.tools/fireprot_2.0","version":"2.0","summary":"FireProt 2.0 is an extension of the original FireProt web for the fully automated design of stable multiple-point mutants.
