{"tool_name":"r-wrassp","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-wrassp","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","summary":"A wrapper around Michel Scheffers libassp (<http://libassp.sourceforge.net/>). The libassp (Advanced Speech Signal Processor) library aims at providing functionality for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large subset of libassp signal processing functions and provides them to the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner."}}}
