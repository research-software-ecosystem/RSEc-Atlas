It can output haplotype-separated BAM files that can be used for downstream analysis. Currently, it only calls single nucleotide variants (SNVs), but it can genotype indels if they are given in an input VCF.","addition_date":"2022-03-21T12:36:31.306716Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:10:49.447193Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Longshot","home":"https://bio.tools/longshot","license":"MIT","summary":"Longshot is a variant calling tool for diploid genomes using long error prone reads such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT).
