Testing it on a set of de novo draft genomes led to the closure of up to 20% of the gaps originally present. It is cross-platform and most of the steps of its pipeline are parallelizable, making easy and fast to improve a draft genome resulting from a de novo assembly.","addition_date":"2016-02-11T16:45:17Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:40:51.270770Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.2.2"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Enly","home":"https://bio.tools/enly","version":"1.2.2","summary":"Simple tool based on the iterative mapping of sequence reads at contig edges, capable to extend the genomic contigs deriving from high-throughput sequencing, especially those deriving by Newbler-like assemblies.
