Originally designed for use with pressure cells on a Quantum Design MPMS3 SQUID magnetometer, SquidLab is a modular object-oriented platform implemented in Matlab with a range of importers for different widely available magnetometer systems (including MPMS, MPMS-XL, MPMS-IQuantum, MPMS3, and S700X models) and has been tested with a broad variety of background and signal types","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:16:45Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-21T15:11:28Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SquidLab","home":"https://bio.tools/squidlab","summary":"user-friendly program for background subtraction and fitting of magnetization data.\n\nWe present an open-source program free to download for academic use with a full user-friendly graphical interface for performing flexible and robust background subtraction and dipole fitting on magnetization data.
