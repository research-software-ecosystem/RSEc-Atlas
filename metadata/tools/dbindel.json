Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown many variants are found within putative enhancer elements. To provide insights into the regulatory role of enhancer-associated noncoding variants in cancer epigenome, and to facilitate the identification of functional noncoding mutations, we present dbInDel, a database where we have comprehensively analyzed enhancer-associated insertion and deletion variants for both human and murine samples using ChIP-Seq data. Moreover, we provide the identification and visualization of upstream TF binding motifs in InDel-containing enhancers. Downstream target genes are also predicted and analyzed in the context of cancer biology.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:06:54Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-17T13:33:13Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"dbInDel","home":"https://bio.tools/dbInDel","summary":"A database of enhancer-associated insertion and deletion variants by analysis of H3K27ac ChIP-Seq.\n\nCancer hallmarks rely on its specific transcriptional programs, which are dysregulated by multiple mechanisms, including genomic aberrations in the DNA regulatory regions.
