These peptides are termed neoantigen and it is important to understand this process for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we introduce an R package that can predict a list of potential neoantigens from a variety of mutations, which include not only somatic point mutations but insertions, deletions, and structural variants.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:20:50Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-14T08:19:37Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"neoantigen","home":"https://bio.tools/neoantigen","summary":"A multifunctional R package for identification of tumor-specific neoantigens.\n\nAbstract It is known that some mutated peptides, such as those resulting from missense mutations and frameshift insertions, can bind to the major histocompatibility complex and be presented to antitumor T-cells on the surface of a tumor cell.
