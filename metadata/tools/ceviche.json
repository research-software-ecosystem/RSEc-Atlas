Linking perturbation signatures to screenings opens the possibility to model cellular phenotypes from expression data and to identify efficacious drugs. We linked perturbation transcriptomics data from the LINCS-L1000 project with cell viability information upon genetic (Achilles project) and chemical (CTRP screen) perturbations yielding more than 90 000 signature-viability pairs. An integrated analysis showed that the cell viability signature is a major factor underlying perturbation signatures. The signature is linked to transcription factors regulating cell death, proliferation and division time","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:46:05Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-10T15:46:33Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"CEVIChE","home":"https://bio.tools/CEVIChE","summary":"Signatures of cell death and proliferation in perturbation transcriptomics data-from confounding factor to effective prediction | Transcriptional perturbation signatures are valuable data sources for functional genomics.
