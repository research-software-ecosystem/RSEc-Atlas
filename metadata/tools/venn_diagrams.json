{"tool_name":"venn_diagrams","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"venn_diagrams","home":"http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/","summary":"With this tool you can calculate the intersection(s) of list of elements. It will generate a textual output indicating which elements are in each intersection or are unique to a certain list. If the number of lists is lower than 6 it will also produce a graphical output in the form of a venn diagram. You have the choice between symmetric (default) or non symmetric venn diagrams. Currently you are able to calculate the intersections of at maximum 30 lists.","addition_date":"2016-01-31T16:35:01Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:50Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["1"],"collections":["BIG N2N","Plant Systems Biology","UGent","VIB"]}}}
