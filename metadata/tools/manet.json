We see evidence of recruitment at work in the metabolic Molecular Ancestry Networks (MANET) database, an online resource that integrates data from KEGG, SCOP and structural phylogenomic reconstruction. The database, which was introduced in 2006, traces the deep history of the structural domains of enzymes in metabolic pathways. Here we release version 3.0 of MANET, which updates data from KEGG and SCOP, links enzyme and PDB information with PDBsum, and traces evolutionary information of domains defined at fold family level of SCOP classification in metabolic subnetwork diagrams.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:49:06Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-22T14:18:30Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MANET","home":"https://bio.tools/MANET","summary":"Hierarchy and modularity in evolving metabolic networks.\n\nEnzyme recruitment is a fundamental evolutionary driver of modern metabolism.
