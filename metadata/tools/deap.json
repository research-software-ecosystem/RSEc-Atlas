DEAP makes significant improvements over existing approaches by including information about pathway structure and discovering the most differentially expressed portion of the pathway. On simulated data, DEAP significantly outperformed traditional methods: with high differential expression, DEAP increased power by two orders of magnitude; with very low differential expression, DEAP doubled the power. DEAP performance was illustrated on two different gene and protein expression studies. DEAP discovered fourteen important pathways related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interferon treatment that existing approaches omitted. On the interferon study, DEAP guided focus towards a four protein path within the 26 protein Notch signalling pathway.","addition_date":"2022-08-01T16:35:47.876911Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:19:33.105851Z","tool_type":["Script"],"collections":["PerMedCoE"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DEAP","home":"https://bio.tools/deap","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"DEAP, Differential Expression Analysis for Pathways, which capitalizes on information about biological pathways to identify important regulatory patterns from differential expression data.
