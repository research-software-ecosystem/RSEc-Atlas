By leveraging changes in accessible chromatin, we can detect significant changes in transcription factor (TF) activity. This is a simple but powerful tool for cellular perturbation analysis. In fact, the applications of DAStk are not necessarily limited to ATAC-seq, but can extend to comparing any pair of bedGraphs containing regions of interest, e.g. transcription regulatory elements (TRE) from nascent transcription assays like PRO-seq, or others like ChIP-seq peaks. To aid downstream analysis, DAStk also includes a graph that combines all human proteins in Uniprot, with their respective annotations, and all human Reactome data on biological pathways, biochemical reactions, and complex formation. This allows the user to query for existing knowledge about what aspects of the significantly changing TFs are shared among two or more of them.","addition_date":"2020-02-14T06:48:08Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:27Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DAStk - Differential ATAC-seq toolkit","home":"https://bio.tools/DAStk_-_Differential_ATAC-seq_toolkit","license":"BSD-3-Clause","version":"1.0.0","summary":"The Differential ATAC-seq Toolkit (DAStk) is a set of command-line tools to aid analyzing differential ATAC-seq data.
