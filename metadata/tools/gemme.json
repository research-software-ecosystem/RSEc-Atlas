Here, we present GEMME (www.lcqb.upmc.fr GEMME), an original and fast method that predicts mutational outcomes by explicitly modelling the evolutionary history of natural sequences.

Assessed against 50 high- and low-throughput mutational experiments, it overall performs similarly or better than existing methods","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:01:59Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-02T20:17:14Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GEMME","home":"https://bio.tools/GEMME","summary":"a simple and fast global epistatic model predicting mutational effects | The systematic and accurate description of protein mutational landscapes is a question of utmost importance in biology, bioengineering and medicine.
