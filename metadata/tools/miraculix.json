It provides highly efficient routines that can be used in statistical analyses of genomic information, e.g. genome-wide association studies, genomic breeding value estimation and population summary statistics. As such, it offers interfaces to allow integration into existing C utilities as well as interoperability with higher-level programming languages such as R, Julia or Fortran.","addition_date":"2024-02-01T16:09:28.940927Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:17:59.645697Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"miraculix","home":"https://bio.tools/miraculix","license":"Apache-2.0","summary":"Accelerated matrix-vector multiplications for matrices involving genotype covariates with applications in genomic prediction.\n\nmiraculix is a C/CUDA library for mathematical operations on compressed genotype data.
