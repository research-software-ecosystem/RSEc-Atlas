Flow cytometry is the preferred method for the immunophenotypic characterization of leukemia and lymphoma, being able to process and register multiparametric data about tens of thousands of cells per second. METHODS:The proposed decision-tree is composed by logistic function nodes that branch throughout the tree into sets of (possible) distinct leukemia lymphoma diagnoses. To avoid overfitting, regularization via the Lasso algorithm was used","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:42:28Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-17T14:45:36Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"decision-tree","home":"https://bio.tools/decision-tree","summary":"A decision-tree approach for the differential diagnosis of chronic lymphoid leukemias and peripheral B-cell lymphomas | BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Here we propose a decision-tree approach for the differential diagnosis of distinct WHO categories B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders using flow cytometry data.
