The selected DNAzyme sequences have the ability to catalyze a broad range of chemical reactions, utilizing DNA, RNA, peptides or small organic compounds as substrates.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:20:53Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-01T19:07:53Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DNAmoreDB","home":"https://bio.tools/dnamoredb","summary":"DNAmoreDB is a database of DNAzymes.
