The algorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It is possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the same reference, or several samples to several references. One can choose between calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set of samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented: RMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both warping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported."}}}
