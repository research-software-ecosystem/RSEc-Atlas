The MVPAlab Toolbox implements several machine learning algorithms to compute multivariate pattern analyses, cross-classification, temporal generalization matrices and feature and frequency contribution analyses. This toolbox has been designed to include an easy-to-use and very intuitive graphic user interface and data representation software, which makes MVPAlab a very convenient tool for those users with few or no previous coding experience. However, MVPAlab is not for beginners only, as it implements several high and low-level routines allowing more experienced users to design their own projects in a highly flexible manner.","addition_date":"2021-11-05T20:23:07.825637Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-05T20:26:23.260650Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MVPAlab","home":"https://bio.tools/mvpalab","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"MVPAlab is a MATLAB-based and very flexible decoding toolbox for multidimensional electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data.
