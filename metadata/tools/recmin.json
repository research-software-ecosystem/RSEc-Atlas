Under certain assumptions the pattern of diversity at a collection of linked sites provides information allowing us to detect historic recombination events. This program calculates a lower bound on the number of recombination events required to construct any history of a sample, under the assumption that each segregating site has mutated only once since the most recent common ancestor of the sample.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:12:05Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:54Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
