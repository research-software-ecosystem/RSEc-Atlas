A promising experimental tool for profiling sense and antisense transcription is strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq). To identify cis-NATs using ssRNA-seq, we developed a new computational method based on model comparison that incorporates the inherent variable efficiency of generating perfectly strand-specific libraries. Applying the method to new ssRNA-seq data from whole root and cell-type specific Arabidopsis libraries confirmed most of the known cis-NAT pairs and identified hundreds of additional cis-NAT pairs."}}}
