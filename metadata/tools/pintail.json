Pintail is a tool for identifying anomalies, including chimeras, within 16S rDNA sequences. The program works by comparing evolutionary distances between a query and subject sequence over the length of the 16S rRNA gene (small subunit rRNA), by employing a sampling window of specified size, progressing a fixed number of bases at a time along the length of the gene.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:11:02Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:54Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.1"]}}}
