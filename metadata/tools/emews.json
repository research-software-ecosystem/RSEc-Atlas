EMEWS has been designed for any \"black box\" application code, such as agent-based and microsimulation models or training of machine learning models, that require multiple runs as part of heuristic model explorations. One of the main goals of EMEWS is to democratize the use of large-scale computing resources by making them accessible to more researchers in many more science domains. EMEWS is built on the Swift/T parallel scripting language.","addition_date":"2022-04-28T15:42:20.890064Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:19:21.617654Z","collections":["PerMedCoE"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EMEWS","home":"https://bio.tools/emews","summary":"The Extreme-scale Model Exploration with Swift (EMEWS) framework enables the direct integration of multi-language model exploration (ME) algorithms while scaling dynamic computational experiments to very large numbers (millions) of models on all major HPC platforms.
