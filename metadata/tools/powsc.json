It can play three roles: parameter estimator, data simulator, and power assessor. As the parameter estimator, POWSC accurately captures the characterized parameters (Fig.B) for any specific cell type from a given real expression data (Fig.A). As the data simulator, POWSC generates sythetic data (Fig.C) based on a rigorous simulation mechanism incluidng zero expression values. As the power assessor, POWSC performs comprehensive power analysis and reports the stratified targeted powers (Fig.D) for two forms of DE genes. A schemetic overview of the aglorithm is shown in (Fig.E).
