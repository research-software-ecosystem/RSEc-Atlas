DRDOCK performs online automatic virtual drug screening of 2016 FDA-approved drugs on a user-submitted target protein. Its goal is to facilitate the drug repurposing to extend the possible treatments toward life-threaten and epidemic diseases. This is achieved by combining the molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to prioritize drugs of strong binders from non-binder. The only things the user required to provide are a well-patched protein structure made of a single peptide chain in PDB format and the target residues IDs to which the drugs expected to bind.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:03:34Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-20T11:14:01Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DRDOCK","home":"https://bio.tools/drdock","summary":"DRDOCK is a drug repurposing platform integrating automated docking, simulations and a log-odds-based drug ranking scheme.
