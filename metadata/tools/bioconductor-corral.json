Whereas PCA is designed for application to continuous, approximately normally distributed data, CA is appropriate for non-negative, count-based data that are in the same additive scale. The corral package implements CA for dimensionality reduction of a single matrix of single-cell data, as well as a multi-table adaptation of CA that leverages data-optimized scaling to align data generated from different sequencing platforms by projecting into a shared latent space. corral utilizes sparse matrices and a fast implementation of SVD, and can be called directly on Bioconductor objects (e.g., SingleCellExperiment) for easy pipeline integration. The package also includes the option to apply CA-style processing to continuous data (e.g., proteomic TOF intensities) with the Hellinger distance adaptation of CA."}}}
