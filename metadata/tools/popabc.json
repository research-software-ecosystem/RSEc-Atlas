The software performs coalescent simulation in the framework of approximate Bayesian computation. It can also be used to perform Bayesian model choice to discriminate between different demographic scenarios.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:15:27Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0"]}}}
