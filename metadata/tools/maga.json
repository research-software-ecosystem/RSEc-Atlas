Based on a regular procedure usually done visually by experts, it looks for group-conserved residues in an alignment. Provided an alignment in FASTA format and a way to group the sequences in it, MAGA seeks to access an unexplored layer of information difficult to appreciate visually when many sequences are aligned, even for a trained bioinformatician.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:11:25Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T08:49:21Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MAGA","home":"https://bio.tools/maga","summary":"A Supervised Method to Detect Motifs From Annotated Groups in Alignments.\n\nMotifs from Annotated Groups in Alignments.\n\nMAGA is a new simpler way to infer information from alignments.
