The current version provides modules for (i) uploading and pre-processing data from microarray expression profiling experiments, (ii) detecting groups of significantly co-expressed genes, and (iii) searching for enrichment of functional annotations within those groups. Moreover, the user interface is designed to simultaneously visualize several types of data such as protein-protein interaction networks in conjunction with expression profiles and cellular co-localization patterns. We have successfully applied the program to interpret expression profiling data from budding yeast, rodents and human.","addition_date":"2018-11-26T08:07:44Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:19:43.793298Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.5.4"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"AMEN","home":"https://bio.tools/amen","version":"1.5.4","summary":"The Annotation, Mapping, Expression and Network (AMEN) software is a stand-alone, unified suite of tools that enables biological and medical researchers with basic bioinformatics training to manage and explore genome annotation, chromosomal mapping, protein-protein interaction, expression profiling and proteomics data.
