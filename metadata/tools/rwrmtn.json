The prediction performance of our method is better than that of some existing state-of-the-art network- and machine learning-based methods since it exploits the mutual regulation between miRNAs and their target genes in the miRNA-target gene interaction networks.\n\nTo facilitate the use of this method, we have developed a Cytoscape app, named RWRMTN, to predict disease-associated miRNAs.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:32:36Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-10T13:12:51Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"RWRMTN","home":"https://bio.tools/rwrmtn","summary":"a tool for predicting disease-associated microRNAs based on a microRNA-target gene network.\n\nThe misregulation of microRNA (miRNA) has been shown to cause diseases.
