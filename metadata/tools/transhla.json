Due the different length of epitopes, we trained two models. The first is TransHLA_I, which is used for the detection of the HLA-I epitope, the other is TransHLA_II, which is used for the detection of the HLA-II epitope.","addition_date":"2024-12-11T08:13:43.311814Z","last_update_date":"2024-12-11T08:17:14.140376Z"}}}
