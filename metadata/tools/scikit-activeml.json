The following code implements an Active Learning Cycle with 20 iterations using a Logistic Regression Classifier and Uncertainty Sampling. To use other classifiers, you can simply wrap classifiers from scikit-learn or use classifiers provided by scikit-activeml. Note that the main difficulty using active learning with scikit-learn is the ability to handle unlabeled data which we denote as a specific value (MISSING_LABEL) in the label vector y_true.","addition_date":"2021-11-29T12:38:05.358532Z","last_update_date":"2021-11-29T12:38:05.361108Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"scikit-activeml","home":"https://bio.tools/scikit-activeml","license":"BSD-3-Clause","summary":"scikit-activeml is a Python module for active learning on top of SciPy and scikit-learn.
