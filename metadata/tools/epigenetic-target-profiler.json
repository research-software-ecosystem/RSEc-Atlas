The identification of protein targets of small molecules is essential for drug discovery. With the increasing amount of chemogenomic data in the public domain, multiple ligand-based models for target prediction have emerged. However, these models are generally biased by the number of known ligands for different targets, which involves an under-representation of epigenetic targets, and despite the increasing importance of epigenetic targets in drug discovery, there are no open tools for epigenetic target prediction.
