{"tool_name":"r-multitaper","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-multitaper","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL-2|GPL-3","summary":"Implements multitaper spectral analysis using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (Slepians) and sine tapers. It includes an adaptive weighted multitaper spectral estimate, a coherence estimate, Thomson's Harmonic F-test, and complex demodulation. The Slepians sequences are generated efficiently using a tridiagonal matrix solution, and jackknifed confidence intervals are available for most estimates."}}}
