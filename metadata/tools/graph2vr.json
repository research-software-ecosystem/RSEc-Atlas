The idea is to explore, analyze, and interact with the data in the graph using gesture control. Graph2VR has been built in Unity and is able to connect to a SPARQL endpoint using dotNetRDF. We got inspired by many different tools to work with Linked data and to visualize Graphs. Virtual Reality offers the user way more space to expand the graph than a 2D computer screen.","addition_date":"2024-04-05T12:43:49.563441Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:05:30.481595Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Graph2VR","home":"https://bio.tools/graph2vr","license":"LGPL-3.0","summary":"Graph2VR is a PhD project, a prototype for a VR application to visualize graphs (SPARQL) as 3D graphs in Virtual Reality.
