This new matrix of enrichment scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods like functional enrichment, survival analysis, etc., in a pathway-centric manner.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:03:41Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-09T16:23:37Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.22.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GSVA","home":"https://bio.tools/gsva","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.22.0","summary":"Non-parametric, unsupervised method for estimating variation of gene set enrichment through the samples of an expression data set.
