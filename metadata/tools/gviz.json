This package uses the biomaRt and the rtracklayer packages to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and UCSC and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript structures in viewports of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic information plotted together with your data.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:05:11Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:55Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.18.1"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
