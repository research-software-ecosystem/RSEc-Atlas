Retro-cues, displayed after the offset of a memory stimulus and prior to the onset of a probe stimulus, indicate the test item and improve performance in VSTM tasks. It has been proposed that retro-cues aid recall by transferring information from a high-capacity memory store into visual working memory (multiple-store hypothesis). Alternatively, retro-cues could aid recall by redistributing memory resources within the same (low-capacity) working memory store (single-store hypothesis). If retro-cues provide access to a memory store with a capacity exceeding the set size, then, given sufficient training in the use of the retro-cue, near-ceiling performance should be observed","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:16:29Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-02T10:30:47Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"retro-cues","home":"https://bio.tools/retro-cues","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Implications for capacity estimation and attentional states in visual working memory.\n\nAccessing the contents of visual short-term memory (VSTM) is compromised by information bottlenecks and visual interference between memorization and recall.
