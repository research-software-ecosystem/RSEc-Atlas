It uses a modified version of spectral clustering that uses a sliding window to quickly detect TADs. The function works on a range of different formats of contact matrices and returns a bed file of TAD coordinates. The method does not require users to adjust any parameters to work and gives them control over the number of hierarchical levels to be returned.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:51:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-21T13:34:59Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SpectralTAD","home":"https://bio.tools/spectraltad","license":"MIT","summary":"an R package for defining a hierarchy of topologically associated domains using spectral clustering.\n\nSpectralTAD: Hierarchical TAD detection using spectral clustering.\n\nSpectralTAD is an R package designed to identify Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) from Hi-C contact matrices.
