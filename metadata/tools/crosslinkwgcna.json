Users are able to upload their data sets and subsequently apply the standard workflow steps using a project-based structure and an easy to navigate interface. Along the way, the tool provides multiple familiar visualizations such as the hierarchically clustered genes with color-coded clusters, a similar tree for the samples and sample traits, module-trait correlations, and more. In addition, the tool allows for integrating multiple WGCNA projects using a correlation-based approach. Both data and visualizations can be exported","addition_date":"2018-08-09T16:12:44Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:01Z","tool_type":["Workflow"],"collections":["Developed_RD-Connect"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"crosslinkWGCNA","home":"https://bio.tools/crosslinkwgcna","summary":"The crosslinkWGCNA web tool provides a user-friendly interface to the popular Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) R package.
