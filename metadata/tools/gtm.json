Recently, an approach to large-scale phylogeny has been proposed that divides a set of species into disjoint subsets, computes trees on the subsets, and then merges the trees together using a computed matrix of pairwise distances between the species. The novel component of these approaches is the last step: Disjoint Tree Merger (DTM) methods. We present GTM (Guide Tree Merger), a polynomial time DTM method that adds edges to connect the subset trees, so as to provably minimize the topological distance to a computed guide tree.
