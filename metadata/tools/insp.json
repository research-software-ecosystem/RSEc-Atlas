Accurate identification of NLSs can help elucidate the functions of nuclear protein complexes. The currently known NLS predictors are usually specific to certain species or largely dependent on prior knowledge of NLS basic residues. Thus, a more general predictor is highly desired to reduce the potentially high false positives or false negatives in discovering new NLSs. Here, we report a new method, INSP (Identification Nucleus Signal Peptide), to effectively identify NLS mainly based on statistical knowledge and machine learning algorithms.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:12:46Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-14T12:38:01Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"INSP","home":"https://bio.tools/INSP","summary":"Discovering nuclear targeting signal sequence through protein language learning and multivariate analysis.\n\nNuclear localization signals (NLSs) are peptides that target proteins to the nucleus by binding to carrier proteins in the cytoplasm that transport their cargo across the nuclear membrane.
