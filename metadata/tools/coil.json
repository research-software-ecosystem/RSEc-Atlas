It contains functions for placing COI-5P barcode sequences into a common reading frame, translating DNA sequences to amino acids and for assessing the likelihood that a given barcode sequence includes an insertion or deletion error. The error assessment relies on the comparison of input sequences against nucleotide and amino acid profile hidden Markov models (for details see Durbin et al. 1998, ISBN: 9780521629713) trained on a taxonomically diverse set of reference sequences. The functions are provided as a complete pipeline and are also available individually for efficient and targeted analysis of barcode data","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:44:02Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-16T16:30:29Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"coil","home":"https://bio.tools/coil","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"an R package for cytochrome C oxidase I (COI) DNA barcode data cleaning, translation, and error evaluation.\n\nContextualization and Evaluation of COI-5P Barcode Data.\n\nDesigned for the cleaning, contextualization and assessment of cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcode data (COI-5P, or the five prime portion of COI).
