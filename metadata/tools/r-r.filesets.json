This package provides classes and methods to locate, setup, subset, navigate and iterate such sets. The API is designed such that these classes can be extended via inheritance to provide a richer API for special file formats. Moreover, a specific name format is defined such that filenames and directories can be considered to have full names which consists of a name followed by comma-separated tags. This adds additional flexibility to identify file sets and individual files."}}}
