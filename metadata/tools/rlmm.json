Using a large training sample where the genotype labels are known, the algorithm will obtain more accurate classification results on new data.

It captures similarities across genotype groups and probes, as well as thousands other SNPs for accurate classification.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:03:58Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:13:01.611369Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.36.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RLMM","home":"https://bio.tools/rlmm","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.36.0","summary":"A classification algorithm, based on a multi-chip, multi-SNP approach for Affymetrix SNP arrays.
