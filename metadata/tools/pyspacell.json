Deciphering spatial phenotypic and molecular effects on the single-cell level is one of the grand challenges and a key to understanding the effects of cell-cell interactions and microenvironment. However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a toolbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:59:49Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T13:48:29.046075Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PySpacell","home":"https://bio.tools/PySpacell","summary":"PySpacell is a Python Package for Spatial Analysis of Cell Images.\n\nTechnologies such as microscopy, sequential hybridization, and mass spectrometry enable quantitative single-cell phenotypic and molecular measurements in situ.
