In particular, RNAenrich adopts a new enrichment strategy, employing RNA-targeted functional genes from experimentally-supported data, which not only makes the most coverage of different types of RNAs but also ensures confidence level of the enriched results. The enrichment results will give a description about which pathway, function and disease these RNAs mainly participate in, presenting as downloadable tables and visual figures.","addition_date":"2023-12-30T20:06:42.317461Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:26:52.149343Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RNAenrich","home":"https://bio.tools/rnaenrich","license":"CC-BY-4.0","summary":"RNAenrich is a web server for functional enrichment and interaction network analysis to almost all types of RNAs, covering mRNA or gene, microRNA ( miRNA ) , long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) , circular RNA (circRNA) , small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) , and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) in human and mouse.
