In simple terms, the most basic functionality allows simulation of a two species binding to each other as a function of their concentrations and the dissociation constant (KD) between the two species. A number of systems are built in and can be solved using direct analytical, kinetic, or Langrange multiplier based techniques. User-defined custom systems can also be specified using a simple syntax.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:56:49Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-30T14:36:13Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PyBindingCurve","home":"https://bio.tools/pybindingcurve","license":"MIT","summary":"PyBindingCurve, simulation and curve fitting to complex binding systems at equilibrium.\n\nPyBindingCurve is a Python package for simulation, plotting and fitting of experimental parameters to protein-ligand binding systems at equilibrium.
