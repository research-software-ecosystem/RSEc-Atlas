This is a tool for predicting biodegradability and/or toxicity, based on the different definitions provided for some of the most popular compound databases. It is easy to use, just introduce a compound in SMILES format or draw its structure with the JSME editor, select the databases that you want to obtain a prediction for and press GO button.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:25:06Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-01T09:25:59Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iBiodegPred","home":"https://bio.tools/ibiodegpred","summary":"Concomitant prediction of environmental fate and toxicity of chemical compounds.\n\nWelcome to SVM Biodegradability predictor.
