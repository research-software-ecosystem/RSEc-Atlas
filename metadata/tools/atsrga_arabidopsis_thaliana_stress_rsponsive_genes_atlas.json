AtSRGA presents stress-responsive genes in a heatmap format based on a stress responsiveness measure (SRscore, see section 2-3 of tutorial). It facilitates the comparative analysis of individual stress responses and groups of genes responsive to multiple stress conditions. Researchers can identify groups of genes with similar patterns by examining the SRscore pattern of a gene of interest across 11 stress conditions. AtSRGA will enhance the screening of biologically significant stress-responsive genes in Arabidopsis in functional genomics research.","addition_date":"2025-01-15T00:33:16.334452Z","last_update_date":"2025-01-15T00:41:02.475884Z","tool_type":["Web application"]}}}
