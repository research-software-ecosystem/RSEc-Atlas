It works by, first, computing overlaps between the long reads, in order to define an alignment pile (i.e. a set of overlapping reads used for correction) for each read. Each read's alignment pile is then further divided into smaller windows, that are corrected idependently. First, a multiple alignment strategy is used in order to compute consensus. Then, this consensus is further polished with a local de Bruijn graph, in order to get rid of the remaining errors. Additionally to error correction, CONSENT can also perform assembly polishing.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:37:30Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-22T09:29:13Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CONSENT","home":"https://bio.tools/consent-correct","license":"AGPL-3.0","summary":"CONSENT (Scalable long read self-correction and assembly polishing with multiple sequence alignment) is a self-correction method for long reads.
