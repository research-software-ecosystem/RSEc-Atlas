Such genes are significantly up- or down-regulated in a small number of conditions. It does so by fitting a mixture of normal distributions to the expression values. Conditions can be environmental conditions, different tissues, organs or any other sources that you wish to compare in terms of gene expression.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:00:53Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:19:14.263933Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.28.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
