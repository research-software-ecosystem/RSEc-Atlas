The tool is based on generalized linear mixed model with spatial correlation structure. The model parameters are fitted using probabilistic programming language Stan [2]. Savage-Dickey Bayes factor estimates are used for statistical testing of a covariate of interest. LuxUS supports both continuous and binary variables. The model takes into account the experimental parameters, such as bisulfite conversion efficiency.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:27:05Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-19T08:10:51Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LuxUS","home":"https://bio.tools/luxus","license":"MIT","summary":"DNA methylation analysis using generalized linear mixed model with spatial correlation.\n\nLuxGLM Using Spatial correlation (LuxUS) is a tool for differential methylation analysis.
