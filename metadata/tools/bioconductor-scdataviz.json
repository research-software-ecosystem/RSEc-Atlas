Additonally, due to the way that scDataviz is designed, which is based on SingleCellExperiment, it has a plug and play feel, and immediately lends itself as flexibile and compatibile with studies that go beyond scDataviz. Finally, the graphics in scDataviz are generated via the ggplot engine, which means that users can add on features to these with ease."}}}
