A perfect phylogeny is a rooted binary tree that recursively partitions DNA sequences. Their nested partition structures provide insight into the pattern of the ancestry of DNA sequence data. For example, disease sequences may cluster together in a local partition indicating that they arise from a common ancestral haplotype. Therefore, the availability of an R package that reconstructs perfect phylogenies should be useful to researchers seeking the ancestral structure of their sequence data.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:41:58Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-09T12:25:55Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"perfectphyloR","home":"https://bio.tools/perfectphyloR","summary":"The perfectphyloR is an R package for reconstructing perfect phylogenies. from DNA Sequence Data.\n\nThe package reconstructs perfect phylogenies underlying a sample of DNA sequences, at a focal single-nucleotide variant (SNV).
