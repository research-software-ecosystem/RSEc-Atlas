After performing genome-wide association studies under an additive, recessive and dominant model for a quantitative trait the pgainsim package allows to determine study specific critical values when one of the three models is more informative than the other ones for a quantitative trait locus. First, study specific p-gain values are simulated. Second, based on the simulated values quantiles of the empirical density of the p-gain are computed. Finally, the quantiles are exported or interpolated and the critical values are obtained.","addition_date":"2021-11-01T13:43:44.083130Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:17:00.701156Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"pgainsim","home":"https://bio.tools/pgainsim","summary":"pgainsim is an R-package to assess the mode of inheritance for quantitative trait loci in GWAS.
