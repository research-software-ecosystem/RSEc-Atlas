The miRvestigator takes as input a list of co-expressed genes and returns the most likely miRNA regulating the genes. It searches for an over-represented sequence motif in the 3' UTRs of the genes using Weeder and compares the motif to all unique miRNA seed sequences in miRBase using our custom built miRvestigator hidden Markov model (HMM).","addition_date":"2017-02-14T09:35:21Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:05:50.353579Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"miRvestigator","home":"https://bio.tools/mirvestigator","summary":"miRvestigator is a web based tool to identify miRNAs mediating co-regulation of gene expression patterns observed in transcriptome profilng data.
