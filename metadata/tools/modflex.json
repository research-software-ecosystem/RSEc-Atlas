The server uses information from the previously developed PDBFlex database which is focused on structural flexibility and conformational diversity of proteins. The PDBFlex database contains structures that were extracted from the PDB and clustered based on sequence identity, such that each cluster represents an individual protein. The structures in each cluster were further grouped into subclusters based on structural similarity, such that each subcluster represents a distinct conformation of the protein. Thus, each cluster represents a protein, while each subcluster represents a specific conformation of that protein.","addition_date":"2021-10-11T06:08:02.252310Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:18:03.708724Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ModFlex","home":"https://bio.tools/modflex","summary":"The ModFlex server provides an interface with multiple options and tools, which make it possible to explore structural diversity in the available modeling templates and make an optimal choice.
