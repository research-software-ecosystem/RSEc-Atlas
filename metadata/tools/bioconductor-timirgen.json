This tool can generate small networks within R or export results into cytoscape or pathvisio for more detailed network construction and hypothesis generation. This tool is created for researchers that wish to dive deep into time series multi-omic datasets. TimiRGeN goes further than many other tools in terms of data reduction. Here, potentially hundreds of thousands of potential miRNA-mRNA interactions can be whittled down into a handful of high confidence miRNA-mRNA interactions effecting a signalling pathway, across a time course."}}}
