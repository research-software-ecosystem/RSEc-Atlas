The input are  variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide alterations  (SNAs) along with allele-specific coverage ratios between the tumor and matched normal sample for somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). These quantities can be directly taken from the output of existing software. Canopy provides a  general mathematical framework for pooling data across samples and sites to  infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that fall within CNA regions, Canopy infers their temporal ordering and resolves their phase.  When there are  multiple evolutionary configurations consistent with the data, Canopy outputs  all configurations along with their confidence assessment."}}}
