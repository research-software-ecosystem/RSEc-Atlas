In general, it fills color into drawn shapes that collectively form a picture that represents the data. The main data source of this program is microarray data, but in situ hybridization-, Northern Blot-, Southern Blot- or any other data can be used. As a result, a picture is produced where the shapes are filled with color that corresponds to the gene expression level.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:05:44Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.1.1"]}}}
