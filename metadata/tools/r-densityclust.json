{"tool_name":"r-densityclust","contents":["biocontainers"],"fetched_metadata":{"biocontainers":{"name":"r-densityclust","identifiers":[],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","summary":"An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the density peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344). It can handle large datasets (> 100, 000 samples) very efficiently. It was initially implemented by Thomas Lin Pedersen, with inputs from Sean Hughes and later improved by Xiaojie Qiu to handle large datasets with kNNs."}}}
