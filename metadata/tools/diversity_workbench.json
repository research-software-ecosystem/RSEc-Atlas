The DWB is handling different kinds of bio- and geodiversity data, taxonomies, terminologies, and facilitates the processing of ecological, molecular biological, observational, collection and taxonomic data. It is capable and flexible enough to be applied as data storage system for institutional data repositories. The DWB is set up on a system of 11 xml-enabled SQL relational databases. The rich clients are installed as desktop applications. The DWB might be run as an intranet solution and provide direct interoperability with clients of interlinked DWB databases including cloud services. DWB installations are flexible in the management of highly structured data, enable sophisticated user administration and allow for user-adapted data entry and data exchange. Further, the DWB design facilitates the dynamic integration of web services and external data resources.","addition_date":"2019-05-23T14:57:48Z","last_update_date":"2020-06-16T10:55:23Z","tool_type":["Workbench"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Diversity Workbench","home":"https://bio.tools/Diversity_Workbench","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"The modularized Diversity Workbench (=DWB) represents a tool suite for the management of life and environmental sciences data.
