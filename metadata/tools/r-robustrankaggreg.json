It implements the Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al in preparation) and some other simple algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model for aggregation that is robust to noise and also facilitates the calculation of significance probabilities for all the elements in the final ranking."}}}
