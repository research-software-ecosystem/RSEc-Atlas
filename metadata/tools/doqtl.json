When founder sequences are available, it can use the haplotype reconstructions to impute the founder sequences onto DO genomes and perform association mapping.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:03:45Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-10T15:32:08Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.10.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DOQTL","home":"https://bio.tools/doqtl","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"1.10.0","summary":"Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping pipeline designed for Diversity Outbred mice and other multi-parent outbred populations.
