It is a free as in freedom replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very similar to it with a few exceptions.\n\nThe most important of these exceptions are, that there are no \u201ctime bombs\u201d; your copy of PSPP will not \u201cexpire\u201d or deliberately stop working in the future. Neither are there any artificial limits on the number of cases or variables which you can use. There are no additional packages to purchase in order to get \u201cadvanced\u201d functions; all functionality that PSPP currently supports is in the core package.","addition_date":"2023-01-31T07:02:12.726573Z","last_update_date":"2023-02-01T12:30:57.520837Z","version":["1.6.2"],"collections":["IMPaCT-Data"]}}}
