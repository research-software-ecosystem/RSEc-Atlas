It includes normal, mixture, or double exponential distributions for SNP effects, i.e. GBLUP, the so-called BayesCPi, and the Bayesian Lasso. It allows estimation of the variances and effects of SNPs, polygenic and environmental effects, and also the inclusion of heterogeneous variances as for the analysis of DYD\u2019s","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:06:59Z","last_update_date":"2019-02-08T10:28:24Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.2.3"]}}}
