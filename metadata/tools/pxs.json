We analyzed data from 459,613 participants of the UK Biobank to investigate the independent and combined roles of demographics (e.g., sex and age), 96 environmental exposures, and common genetic variants in atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 2 diabetes. We develop an additive modelling approach to estimate and validate a poly-exposure score (PXS) that goes beyond consideration of a handful of factors such as smoking and pollution","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:04:22Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-10T12:49:15Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PXS","home":"https://bio.tools/PXS","summary":"Poly-Exposure and Poly-Genomic Scores Implicate Prominent Roles of Non-Genetic and Demographic Factors in Four Common Diseases in the UK.\n\nABSTRACT While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been shown to identify a small number of individuals with increased clinical risk for several common diseases, non-genetic factors that change during a lifetime, such as lifestyle, employment, diet, and pollution, have a larger role in clinical prediction.
