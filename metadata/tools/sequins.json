It may be run with phases from experimental phasing, or it can calculate its own phases using a side-chain-omit process. In this case it can be used after molecular replacement, or to validate structures in the PDB.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:15:39Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:54Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["20070909"]}}}
