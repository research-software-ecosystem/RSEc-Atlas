We developed an unsupervised clustering approach for identifying clinically relevant expression patterns. The hydra analysis framework uses state-of-the-art Bayesian non-parametric statistics to learn which genes are differentially expressed without the need for matched normal expression data. This is very useful in the pediatric oncology setting where matched normal tissue is usually not available.\n\n||| NAME (hydra) SIMILAR TO (PUB.
