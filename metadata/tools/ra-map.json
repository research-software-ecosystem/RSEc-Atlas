The complex mechanism of aetiopathogenesis, progress and chronicity of the disease involves genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying disease phenotypes, one has to place implicated factors in their functional context. However, integration and organization of such data in a systematic manner remains a challenging task. Molecular maps are widely used in biology to provide a useful and intuitive way of depicting a variety of biological processes and disease mechanisms.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:40:21Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-03T13:36:28Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"RA-map","home":"https://bio.tools/ra-map","summary":"building a state-of-the-art interactive knowledge base for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive, inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology.
