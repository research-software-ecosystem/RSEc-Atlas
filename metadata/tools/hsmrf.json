Both directories contain more extensive readme files.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:44:34Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-10T09:53:41Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HSMRF","home":"https://bio.tools/HSMRF","summary":"Locally adaptive Bayesian birth-death model successfully detects slow and rapid rate shifts.\n\nCode for our work developing and characterizing the HSMRF priors for birth-death processes.\n\nThis repository contains code for analyses from \"Locally adaptive Bayesian birth-death model successfully detects slow and rapid rate shifts\" (Magee et al. 2019).
