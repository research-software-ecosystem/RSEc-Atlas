The CONTRAlign framework enables the development of feature-rich alignment models which generalize well to previously unseen sequences and avoid overfitting by controlling model complexity through regularization.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:04:50Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.01"]}}}
