It solves marker ordering problems and can also join maps (genetic or radiated hybrid) on various pedigrees: backcross, RI (ri self, ri sib), F2 intercross, phase known outbreds, haploid and diploid radiation hybrids up to now.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:39:18Z","last_update_date":"2019-02-11T20:37:34Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]}}}
