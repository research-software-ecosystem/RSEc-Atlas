UMI-4C is a technique that allows characterization of 3D chromatin interactions with a bait of interest, taking advantage of a sonication step to produce unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that help remove duplication bias, thus allowing a better differential comparsion of chromatin interactions between conditions. This package allows processing of UMI-4C data, starting from FastQ files provided by the sequencing facility. It provides two statistical methods for detecting differential contacts and includes a visualization function to plot integrated information from a UMI-4C assay.","addition_date":"2021-12-13T12:24:04.252582Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:14:15.828431Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"UMI4Cats","home":"https://bio.tools/umi4cats","license":"Artistic-2.0","summary":"UMI4Cats is an R package to analyze processing, analysis and visualization of UMI-4C chromatin contact data.
