This allows to deduce the real spoligotype, to detect mutants of spacers and direct repeats, insertion of mobile elements, and duplications. The Cas locus is reconstructed too. This is a semi automatic approach that leads to a set of contigs to assemble manually. Depending on the number, length, and quality of SRAs, the number of contigs can range from 1-2 patterns, in the best case scenario where the good quality of sequences allows a quasi-automatic reconstruction of the CRISPR cut in mobile element positions, to several contigs difficult to process, for too short or polluted reads.","addition_date":"2021-06-14T12:37:50Z","last_update_date":"2021-08-23T19:12:53Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CRISPRbuilder-TB","home":"https://bio.tools/crisprbuilder-tb","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"CRISPRbuilder-TB is a tool that reconstructs the whole CRISPR locus from a Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genome, by using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data.
