Users can search the database based on gene id/symbol, or by specific tissue/cell type and filter results based on any combination of tissue/cell specificity, Known/Novel, CpG/NonCpG, and protein-coding/non-coding gene promoters. Also integrated is a GBrowse genome browser for visualization of ChIP-seq profiles and to display the annotations.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T08:35:29Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:50Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
