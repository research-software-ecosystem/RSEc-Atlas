We define a cluster as a group of homologous proteins that are found grouped together in at least two different genomes and which are more conserved than what is expected for the pair of genomes. The order of the genes inside the cluster is not necessarily conserved. Pairwise clusters are grouped into multi-species families.","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:39:47Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:49:15.851119Z","tool_type":["Database portal"],"version":["1.0"],"collections":["IMPaCT-Data"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"EvolClust","home":"https://bio.tools/EvolClust","version":"1.0","summary":"EvolClust predicts groups of genes that are conserved in terms of gene order across different species distinguishing it from the background gene order conservation found between species.
