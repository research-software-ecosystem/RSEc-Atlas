Researchers can use this toolkit to 1) implement slide-window approach for analyzing functional connectivity dynamics; 2) generate task condition files based on the experimental task, 3) calculate functional network topological measures and examine their dynamics, and 4) visually validate the results.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:57:06Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-22T12:23:51Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GAT-FD","home":"https://bio.tools/gat-fd","summary":"An Integrated MATLAB Toolbox for Graph Theoretical Analysis of Task-Related Functional Dynamics.\n\nGraph Theoretical Analysis of Task-based Functional Dynamics Toolbox.\n\nGraph theoretical analysis of task-related functional dynamics (GAT-FD) is a systematically integrated user-friendly toolkit to characterize the functional dynamics for task-related fMRI data based on graph theoretical techniques.
