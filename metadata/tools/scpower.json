It enables the user to calculate the power for a given experimental setup and to choose for a restricted budget the optimal combination of experimental parameters which maximizes the power. Necessary experimental priors, e.g. effect sizes and expression distributions, can be taken from example data sets, saved in the package, or estimated from new data sets. The tool was evaluated with data from different tissues and single cell technologies, based on UMI counts and read counts.","addition_date":"2021-11-29T12:50:42.486150Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:15:27.548615Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"scPower","home":"https://bio.tools/scpower","summary":"scPower is a R package for design and power analysis of cell type specific interindividual DE and eQTL studies using single cell RNA-seq.
