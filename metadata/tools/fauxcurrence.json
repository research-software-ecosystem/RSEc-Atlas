The package generates sets of randomised occurrences (long & lat coordinates) for one or more species with a spatial structure (within- and between-species distances) matching that of an observed set of coordinates. These can be used to define null expectations to test hypotheses in ecology and biogeography.","addition_date":"2021-09-08T16:16:52Z","last_update_date":"2021-09-13T11:35:10Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"fauxcurrence","home":"https://bio.tools/fauxcurrence","summary":"fauxcurrence is an R package for simulating multi-species occurrences for null models in species distribution modelling and biogeography.
