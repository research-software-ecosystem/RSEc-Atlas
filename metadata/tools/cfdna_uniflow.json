It includes essential steps for pre-processing raw cfDNA samples, quality control and reporting. Additionally, several optional utility functions like GC bias correction and estimation of copy number state are included. Finally, we provide specialized methods for extracting coverage derived signals and visualizations comparing cases and controls.","addition_date":"2024-08-07T10:02:33.363604Z","last_update_date":"2024-08-07T10:02:33.367128Z","tool_type":["Workflow"]}}}
