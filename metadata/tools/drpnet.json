Identification and selection of protein particles in cryo-electron micrographs is an important step in single particle analysis. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based particle picking network to automatically detect particle centers from cryoEM micrographs. This is a challenging task due to the nature of cryoEM data, having low signal-to-noise ratios with variable particle sizes, shapes, distributions, grayscale variations as well as other undesirable artifacts.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:04:34Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-10T11:19:04Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DRPnet","home":"https://bio.tools/drpnet","summary":"Deep Regression Picker Network (DRPnet) is a tool for automated particle picking in cryo-electron micrographs using deep regression.
