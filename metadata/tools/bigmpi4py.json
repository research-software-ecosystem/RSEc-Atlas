BigMPI4py automatically determines the optimal object distribution strategy, and uses vectorized methods, achieving higher parallelization efficiency. BigMPI4py facilitates the implementation of Python for Big Data applications in multicore workstations and High Performance Computer systems. We use BigMPI4py to speed-up the search for germ line specific de novo DNA methylated unmethylated motifs from the 59 whole genome bisulfite sequencing DNA methylation samples from 27 human tissues of the ENCODE project.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:30:19Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-03T19:43:53Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BigMPI4py","home":"https://bio.tools/bigmpi4py","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"BigMPI4py is a Python module that wraps mpi4py, supporting object sizes beyond this boundary.
