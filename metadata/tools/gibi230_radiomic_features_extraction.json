It streamlines the radiomics calculation process by generating a structured CSV file containing all extracted variables from medical images.\nThe dockerized software enables users to configure parameters like filters, bin width, resampling spacing, and normalization settings can be specified. The output radiomic variables provide quantitative information for further analysis in medical imaging research and machine learning applications. \nSpecially important the parameter selection of the band width. For robust and reproducible results, a bin width of 5 is commonly recommended, but it should be adjusted based on image resolution, modality, and noise levels.","addition_date":"2024-12-23T12:44:47.964606Z","last_update_date":"2025-06-05T11:07:12.219171Z","version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["EUCAIM"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Radiomic features extraction (EUCAIM-SW-054_T-02-01-003)","home":"https://bio.tools/gibi230_radiomic_features_extraction","version":"1.0.0","summary":"Implemented by GIBI230, this tool is a Docker-based software designed for extracting radiomic features from 3D medical images in NIfTI format using the PyRadiomics library (if DICOM images, the DICOM to NIFTI converter must be run before using this tool).
