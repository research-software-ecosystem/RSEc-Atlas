HDF5's main features are the ability to store and access very large and/or complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage (disk) through a completely portable file format. The package is thus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R and other software package, and for letting R applications work on datasets that are larger than the available RAM.","addition_date":"2016-02-11T13:26:02Z","last_update_date":"2019-02-15T09:57:30Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.26.0"],"collections":["Bioconductor","de.NBI"]}}}
