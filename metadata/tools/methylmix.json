Based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state.

Matched gene expression data is used to identify, besides differential, functional methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:02:24Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:51:37.303396Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.8.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MethylMix","home":"https://bio.tools/methylmix","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.8.0","summary":"Algorithm implemented to identify hyper/hypomethylated genes for a disease.
