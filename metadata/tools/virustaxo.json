VirusTaxo classifies DNA and RNA viruses to their taxonomic ranks using genome sequence. To assign taxonomic ranks, VirusTaxo extracts k-mers from genome sequence and creates bag-of-k-mers for each class in a rank. VirusTaxo uses a top-down hierarchical classification approach by enriching k-mers and accurately assigns the order, family and genus of a virus from the genome sequence.","addition_date":"2021-12-13T13:56:47.138094Z","last_update_date":"2021-12-13T13:58:03.926027Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"VirusTaxo","home":"https://bio.tools/virustaxo","summary":"VirusTaxo is a tool for taxonomic classification of virus genome using multi-class hierarchical classification by k-mer enrichment.
