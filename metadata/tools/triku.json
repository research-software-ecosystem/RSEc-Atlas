Triku is a feature selection method that favours genes defining the main cell populations. It does so by selecting genes expressed by groups of cells that are close in the nearest neighbor graph. Triku efficiently recovers cell populations present in artificial and biological benchmarking datasets, based on mutual information and silhouette coefficient measurements. Additionally, gene sets selected by triku are more likely to be related to relevant Gene Ontology terms, and contain fewer ribosomal and mitochondrial genes.
