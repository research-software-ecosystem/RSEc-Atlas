In disease gene identification and classification, the main aim is to identify disease genes while identifying non-disease genes are of less or no significant. Hence, this task can be defined as a one-class classification problem. Existing machine learning methods typically take into consideration known disease genes as positive training set and unknown genes as negative samples to build a binary-class classification model. Here we propose a new One-class Classification Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) method to precisely classify candidate disease genes.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:52:28Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T12:52:00Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OCSVM","home":"https://bio.tools/OCSVM","summary":"A novel one-class classification approach to accurately predict disease-gene association in acute myeloid leukemia cancer.\n\nDisease causing gene identification is considered as an important step towards drug design and drug discovery.
