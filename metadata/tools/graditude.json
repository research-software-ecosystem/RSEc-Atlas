Grad-seq separates native cellular lysates including complexes, according to their molecular weight and shape in a glycerol gradient, independent of charge and sequence. After this fractionation, RNA-seq and MS-analysis of each of the fractions generated allows the reconstruction of the sedimentation profiles of all detectable RNAs and protein in a single experiment. Further analysis can reveal possible interactions between the individual molecules.","addition_date":"2021-10-14T10:06:39.012130Z","last_update_date":"2022-12-01T20:29:00.992851Z"}}}
