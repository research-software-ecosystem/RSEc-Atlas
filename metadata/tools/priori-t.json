However, the effectiveness of gene prioritization tools is constrained by the incomplete coverage of rare disease, phenotype and gene annotations in such curated resources. METHODS:We extracted rare disease correlation pairs involving diseases, phenotypes and genes from MEDLINE abstracts and used the information propagation algorithm GCAS to build an association network. We built a tool called PRIORI-T for rare disease gene prioritization that uses this network for phenotype-driven rare disease gene prioritization.
