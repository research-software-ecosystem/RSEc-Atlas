It also allows fast and memory efficient analysis of standard conservation measures such as phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism, evolutionary distinctiveness and global endangerment. phyloregion can run on any operating system (Mac, Linux, Windows or even high performance computing cluster) with R 3.6.0 (or higher) installed.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:33:21Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-23T15:54:05Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"phyloregion","home":"https://bio.tools/phyloregion","summary":"R package for biogeographic regionalization and spatial conservation.\n\nAn R package for biogeographic regionalization (the classification of geographical areas in terms of their biotas) and macroecology.
