{"tool_name":"xeml-lab","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"xeml-lab","home":"https://services.cbib.u-bordeaux.fr/linda/","license":"MIT","summary":"The web application Linda offers a complete tool for entering and managing metadata associated with a phenotyping experiment on plants. It thus makes it possible to intuitively describe experimental related information such as, for example, the experimental design, the growth protocols, the environmental variable measurements, etc. Linda is coupled with a database that stores this information in a structured manneer using oriented graphs. This database uses reference ontologies (e.g., Plant Ontology, Crop Ontology, etc.) and standards dedicated to this type of experiment such as the Minimal Information About Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE) standard. Data sharing is facilitated on the one hand by respecting the FAIR principles (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) and oon the other hand, by exporting this metadata relating to the experiment in tabulated formats or formatted for submission in the international databases (ISA-tab).","addition_date":"2015-10-29T14:34:58Z","last_update_date":"2022-09-27T14:48:43.394660Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["1"]}}}
