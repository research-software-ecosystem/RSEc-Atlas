It deals with all the issues of qPCR related calculations from data consistency, pipetting errors, standard curve parameters, individual sample efficiencies/inhibition, range of quantification and normalization to one or several reference genes. In this way it enables robust quality controlled quantification of nucleic acids.","addition_date":"2016-06-28T18:26:46Z","last_update_date":"2020-07-23T15:03:34Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["1"],"collections":["ELIXIR-SI"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"quantGenius","home":"https://bio.tools/quantgenius","license":"GPL-3.0","version":"1","summary":"Web-based tool for the quantification of qPCR data using standard curve approach and QC-based decision support system in a high-throughput setting.
