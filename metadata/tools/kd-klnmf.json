In this paper, a novel statistical model named KD-KLNMF is constructed to predict lncRNAs subcellular localization. Firstly, k-mer and dinucleotide-based spatial autocorrelation are incorporated as the feature vector. Then, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique is used to deal with the imbalance dataset.
