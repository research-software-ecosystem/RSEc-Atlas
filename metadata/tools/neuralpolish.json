{"tool_name":"neuralpolish","contents":["biotools","bioschemas"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"neuralpolish","home":"https://github.com/huangnengCSU/NeuralPolish.git","license":"MIT","summary":"NeuralPolish is a Nanopore polishing method based on alignment matrix construction and orthogonal Bi-GRU Networks. The method is designed as an alignment feature matrix for representing read-to-assembly alignment. Each row of the matrix represents a read, and each column represents the aligned bases at each position of the contig. In the network architecture, a bi-directional GRU network is used to extract the sequence information inside each read by processing the alignment matrix row by row. After that, the feature matrix is processed by another bi-directional GRU network column by column to calculate the probability distribution. Finally, a CTC decoder generates a polished sequence with a greedy algorithm.","addition_date":"2021-10-25T06:38:03.561618Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-25T06:38:03.618390Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"NeuralPolish","home":"https://bio.tools/neuralpolish","license":"MIT","summary":"NeuralPolish is a Nanopore polishing method based on alignment matrix construction and orthogonal Bi-GRU Networks.
