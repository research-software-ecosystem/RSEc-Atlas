This increase in digital recordings necessitates an increase in high-throughput methods of analysis for researchers. Specifically, there is a need in the community for open-source methods that are tailored to recordings of varying qualities and from multiple species collected in nature. We developed Chipper, a Python-based software to semi-automate both the segmentation of acoustic signals and the subsequent analysis of their frequencies and durations.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:54:34Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-11T20:01:03Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Chipper","home":"https://bio.tools/Chipper","summary":"Open-source software for semi-automated segmentation and analysis of birdsong and other natural sounds.\n\nAbstract <jats:list list-type=\"order\"><jats:list-item> Audio recording devices have changed significantly over the last 50 years, making large datasets of recordings of natural sounds, such as birdsong, easier to obtain.
