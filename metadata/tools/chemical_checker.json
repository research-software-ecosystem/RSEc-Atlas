The CC divides data into five levels of increasing complexity, ranging from the chemical properties of compounds to their clinical outcomes. In between, it considers targets, off-targets, perturbed biological networks and several cell-based assays such as gene expression, growth inhibition and morphological profilings. In the CC, bioactivity data are expressed in a vector format, which naturally extends the notion of chemical similarity between compounds to similarities between bioactivity signatures of different kinds.","addition_date":"2021-01-25T09:57:00Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:19:35.852564Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Chemical Checker","home":"https://bio.tools/chemical_checker","summary":"The Chemical Checker (CC) is a resource that provides processed, harmonized and integrated bioactivity data on 800,000 small molecules.
