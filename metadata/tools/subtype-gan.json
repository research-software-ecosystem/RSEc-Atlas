The input for the framework is copy number, mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and other omics data. The output is the corresponding subclass label for each sample. SubtypeGAN is mainly divided into two components: 1. GAN-based feature extraction module is used to obtain latent variables from each type of omics data. 2. Consensus clustering and the Gaussian Mixture model determine the number of subtypes and the cluster label corresponding to each sample.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:05:44Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-10T09:56:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Subtype-GAN","home":"https://bio.tools/subtype-gan","summary":"a deep learning approach for integrative cancer subtyping of multi-omics data.\n\nSubtype-GAN is a cancer subtype framework based on multi-omics profiles.
