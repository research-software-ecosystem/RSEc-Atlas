To overcome these challenges, therefore, we developed WingMesh. This is an application for simple yet precise automatic modeling of insect wings. Using a series of examples, we showed the performance of our application in practice. We expect WingMesh to be particularly useful in comparative studies, especially where the modeling of a large number of insect wings is required within a short time.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:34:08Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-18T09:40:38Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"WingMesh","home":"https://bio.tools/wingmesh","summary":"A Matlab-Based Application for Finite Element Modeling of Insect Wings.\n\nManual modeling of complicated insect wings presents considerable practical challenges.
