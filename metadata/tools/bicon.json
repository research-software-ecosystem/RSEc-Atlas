BiCoN is a network-constrained biclustering approach which restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and maximizes the expression difference between two groups of patients. To alleviate this, we developed the network-constrained biclustering approach BiCoN which (i) restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and (ii) maximizes the expression difference between two subgroups of patients.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:32:21Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:45:56.233388Z","tool_type":["Library","Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BiCoN","home":"https://bio.tools/bicon","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Biclustering constrained by networks (BiCoN) is a powerful new systems medicine tool to stratify patients while elucidating disease mechanisms.
