The input data can be targeted amplicon bulk sequencing data of the V, D, J and C regions of the B/T-cell receptor with multiplex PCR or 5' RACE protocol, single-cell VDJ sequencing using the 10xGenomics libraries, or assembled reads (bulk or single-cell). It can also extract BCR and TCR sequences from bulk or single-cell untargeted RNAseq data. It makes use of the Immcantation toolset as well as other AIRRseq analysis tools. The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.","addition_date":"2025-05-19T15:20:08.961227Z","last_update_date":"2025-05-19T15:20:08.964291Z","tool_type":["Workflow"],"collections":["nf-core"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"nf-core airrflow","home":"https://bio.tools/nf-core_airrflow","license":"MIT","summary":"nf-core/airrflow is a bioinformatics best-practice pipeline to analyze B-cell or T-cell repertoire sequencing data.
