To help in this task, there has been a growing use of classification methods (from machine learning) to learn models that predict whether a gene influences the process of ageing or promotes longevity. One type of predictive feature often used for learning such classification models is Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) features. One important property of PPI features is their uncertainty, i.e., a given feature (PPI annotation) is often associated with a confidence score, which is usually ignored by conventional classification methods. Hence, we propose the Lazy Feature Selection for Uncertain Features (LFSUF) method, which is tailored for coping with the uncertainty in PPI confidence scores","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:46:15Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-16T08:28:37Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LFSUF","home":"https://bio.tools/pub2tools2020__lfsuf","summary":"An Application to the Prediction of Pro-/Anti- Longevity Genes.\n\nUnderstanding the ageing process is a very challenging problem for biologists.
