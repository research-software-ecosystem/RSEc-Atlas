Researchers are developing surface electromyography and machine learning solutions to control dexterous and robotic prosthetic hands, however long computational times can slow down this process. Objective: This paper aims at creating a fast signal feature extraction algorithm that can extract widely used features and allow researchers to easily add new ones. Methods: PaWFE (Parallel Window Feature Extractor) extracts the signal features from several time windows in parallel. The MATLAB code is publicly available and supports several time domain and frequency features","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:54:16Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-01T10:58:06Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PaWFE","home":"https://bio.tools/PaWFE","summary":"Fast Signal Feature Extraction Using Parallel Time Windows | Motivation: Hand amputations can dramatically affect the quality of life of a person.
