Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for a better understanding of the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, we developed the first comprehensive viral posttranslational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of PTMs in human viruses and infected host cells. The VPTMdb contains 1240 unique viral PTM sites with 8 modification types from 43 viruses (818 experimentally verified PTM sites manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from SwissProt) as well as 13 650 infected cells' PTMs extracted from seven global proteomics experiments in six human viruses","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:14:01Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-13T15:42:53Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"VPTMdb","home":"https://bio.tools/vptmdb","summary":"a viral posttranslational modification database.\n\nIn viruses, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are essential for their life cycle.
