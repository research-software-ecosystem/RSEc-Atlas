It consists of question classification, document retrieval, passage retrieval and answer extraction modules. It is aimed to be able to accept a variety of natural language questions and to generate appropriate natural language answers by providing both exact and ideal answers (paragraph-sized summaries). It provides exact answers \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for yes/no questions, biomedical named entities for factoid questions, and a list of biomedical named entities for list questions. In addition to exact answers for yes/no, factoid and list questions, SemBioNLQA also returns ideal answers, while it retrieves only ideal answers for summary questions.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T06:58:47Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-16T14:12:34Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SemBioNLQA","home":"https://bio.tools/sembionlqa","summary":"A semantic biomedical question answering system for retrieving exact and ideal answers to natural language questions.\n\nSemBioNLQA - Semantic Biomedical Natural Language Question Answering - has the ability to handle the kinds of yes/no questions, factoid questions, list questions and summary questions that are commonly asked in the biomedical domain.
