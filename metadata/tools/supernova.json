A key feature of Supernova is that it creates diploid assemblies, thus separately representing maternal and paternal chromosomes over very long distances. Almost all other methods instead merge homologous chromosomes into single incorrect 'consensus' sequences. Supernova is the only practical method for creating diploid assemblies of large genomes.","addition_date":"2021-05-27T09:17:19Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:20:48.013501Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Suite","Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Supernova","home":"https://bio.tools/supernova","license":"Proprietary","summary":"Supernova is a software package for de novo assembly from Chromium Linked-Reads that are made from a single whole-genome library from an individual DNA source.
