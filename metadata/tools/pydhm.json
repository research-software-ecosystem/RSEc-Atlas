The pyDHM is a user-friendly library written in the robust programming language of Python that provides a set of numerical processing algorithms for reconstructing amplitude and phase images for a broad range of optical DHM configurations. The pyDHM implements phase-shifting approaches for in-line and slightly off-axis systems and enables phase compensation for telecentric and non-telecentric systems. In addition, pyDHM includes three propagation algorithms for numerical focusing complex amplitude distributions in DHM and digital holography (DH) setups.
