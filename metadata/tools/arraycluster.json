This task can be addressed by grouping gene expression patterns of the collected samples on the basis of a large number of genes. Application of commonly used clustering methods to such a dataset however are likely to fail, because the number of samples to be grouped is much smaller than the data dimension. To overcome such difficulty, a novel model-based clustering method is developed.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:41Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:35:52.105732Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ArrayCluster","home":"https://bio.tools/arraycluster","version":"1.0","summary":"It is one of the significant challenges to find unknown subtypes of several diseases at the molecular levels.
