Primers are designed by solving a set cover problem such that the number of covered template sequences is maximized with the smallest possible set of primers. To guarantee that high-quality primers are generated, only primers fulfilling constraints on their physicochemical properties are selected.","addition_date":"2018-07-24T15:49:41Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.2.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
