ChIA-PET (chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tags) enables genome-wide discovery of chromatin interactions involving specific protein factors, with base pair resolution. Interpretation of ChIA-PET data requires a robust analytic pipeline. Here, we introduce ChIA-PIPE, a fully automated pipeline for ChIA-PET data processing, quality assessment, visualization, and analysis. ChIA-PIPE performs linker filtering, read mapping, peak calling, and loop calling and automates quality control assessment for each dataset. To enable visualization, ChIA-PIPE generates input files for two-dimensional contact map viewing with Juicebox and HiGlass and provides a new dockerized visualization tool for high-resolution, browser-based exploration of peaks and loop.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:29:04Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T15:59:02Z","tool_type":["Script","Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ChIA-PIPE","home":"https://bio.tools/chia-pipe","summary":"ChIA-PIPE is a fully automated pipeline for comprehensive ChIA-PET data analysis and visualization.
