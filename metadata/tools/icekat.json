ICEKAT allows users to interactively fit kinetic traces using convenient browser-based selection tools, ameliorating tedious steps involved in defining ranges to fit in general purpose programs like Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism, while still maintaining simplicity in determining initial rates. As a test case, we quickly analyzed over 500 continuous enzyme kinetic traces resulting from experimental data on the response of the protein lysine deacetylase Sirt1 to small-molecule activators.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:57:38Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-01T09:30:50Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ICEKAT","home":"https://bio.tools/icekat","license":"MIT","summary":"An interactive online tool for calculating initial rates from continuous enzyme kinetic traces.\n\nAn Interactive Continuous Enzyme Kinetics Analysis Tool (ICEKAT) was developed for semi-automated calculation of initial rates from continuous enzyme kinetic traces with particular application to the evaluation of Michaelis-Menten and EC50/IC50 kinetic parameters, as well as the results of high-throughput screening assays.
