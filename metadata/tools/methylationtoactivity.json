Here we present MethylationToActivity (M2A), a machine learning framework that uses convolutional neural networks to infer promoter activities based on H3K4me3 and H3K27ac enrichment, from DNA methylation patterns for individual genes. Using publicly available datasets in real-world test scenarios, we demonstrate that M2A is highly accurate and robust in revealing promoter activity landscapes in various pediatric and adult cancers, including both solid and hematologic malignant neoplasms","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:47:49Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-11T09:21:02Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MethylationToActivity","home":"https://bio.tools/methylationtoactivity","summary":"A deep-learning framework that reveals promoter activity landscapes from DNA methylomes in individual tumors.\n\nAlthough genome-wide DNA methylomes have demonstrated their clinical value as reliable biomarkers for tumor detection, subtyping, and classification, their direct biological impacts at the individual gene level remain elusive.
