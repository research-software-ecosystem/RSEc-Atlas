Specifically, it can be used to investigate the effect of telomere length on gene regulation. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that shorten with every cell division. The regulation of a number of genes has been reported to depend on the length of telomeres. Gene positions across species can be a valuable dataset for analyzing effects like this because genes that are regulated by position effects may exhibit patterns in the position of their orthologs.","addition_date":"2024-05-20T16:08:27.345178Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T13:57:12.169920Z","tool_type":["Script","Web application"],"version":["1.0.1"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TPE-OLD","home":"https://bio.tools/tpe-old","license":"AGPL-3.0","version":"1.0.1","summary":"Interactive tool to analyze genes based on their position across species.
