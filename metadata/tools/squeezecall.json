A Squeezeformer network is employed to capture global context. Finally, a CTC decoder generates the DNA sequence by a beam search algorithm. Experiments on multiple species further demonstrate the potential of the Squeezeformer-based model to improve basecalling accuracy and its superiority over a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based model and Transformer-based models.","addition_date":"2025-01-21T07:17:21.626185Z","last_update_date":"2025-01-21T07:21:03.653555Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
