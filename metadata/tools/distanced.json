Specifically, it estimates the diversity of ribosomal DNA sequences within microbial communities. Estimating diversity of microbes is a challenge because errors in sequence create false sequences and inflate diversity. Distanced overcomes this problem by correcting values of mean pairwise distance, a measure of within-sample diversity, for the expected increase after sequencing | Distanced requires a set a DNA sequence reads in fastq format. A set of reference sequences in fasta format is optional. If reference sequences are provided, Distanced will report the actual diversity of the DNA sequences, providing a check on accuracy","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:55:05Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-02T16:58:21Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Distanced","home":"https://bio.tools/distanced","summary":"Accurate estimation of microbial sequence diversity with Distanced | Distanced is a bioinformatics tool that estimates diversity of microbes.
