Unlike many machine-learning approaches (e.g., AlphaFold2, TrRosetta, RaptorX), it integrates the Debye-H\u00fcckel formalism for charged side-chain interactions with a Mie potential for intramolecular forces. Based on a coarse-grained representation, PEP-FOLD4 performs competitively on well-structured peptides and shows significant improvements for poly-charged peptides, making it particularly useful for studying pH- and salt-dependent conformations.","addition_date":"2025-03-04T16:25:28.372680Z","last_update_date":"2025-03-05T16:21:19.399517Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PEP-FOLD4","home":"https://bio.tools/pep-fold4","summary":"PEP-FOLD4 is a fast and accurate structure prediction tool for peptides of up to 40 amino acids in aqueous solutions.
