It is written in ISO C and C++, provides language bindings for Common Lisp, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB and Octave, and includes many features that facilitate adoption and use of both SBML and the library. Developers can embed libSBML in their applications, saving themselves the work of implementing their own SBML parsing, manipulation and validation software."},"biotools":{"id":"libsbml","home":"http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML","summary":"A free, open-source programming library to help you read, write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams.
