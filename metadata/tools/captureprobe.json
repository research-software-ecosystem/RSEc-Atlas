CaptureProbe is easy-to-use, only need simple input files and provides abundant parameters for designing probes. CaptureProbe can design probes specifically for both genomic sites and genomic regions of interest. Comparisons with existing softwares (HiCapTools and GOPHER) indicated that CaptureProbe has a good design success ratio and better probe specificity.\n\nCitation: MA Y F, ADEOLA A C, SUN Y B, et al. 2020.
