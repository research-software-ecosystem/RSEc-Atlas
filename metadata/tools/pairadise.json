Unlike conventional approaches that detect ASAS events one sample at a time, PAIRADISE aggregates ASAS signals across multiple individuals in a population. By treating the two alleles of an individual as paired, and multiple individuals sharing a heterozygous SNP as replicates, PAIRADISE formulates ASAS detection as a statistical problem for identifying differential alternative splicing from RNA-seq data with paired replicates.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:27:54Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-15T14:42:30Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PAIRADISE","home":"https://bio.tools/pairadise","license":"MIT","summary":"PAIRADISE (PAIred Replicate analysis of Allelic DIfferential Splicing Events) is a method for detecting allele-specific alternative splicing (ASAS) from RNA-seq data.
