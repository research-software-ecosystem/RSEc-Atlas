Independent introns, referring to those introns that do not overlap with any exons of any splice isoforms, are used for detecting IRs. iREAD takes two input files: (1) a BAM file representing transcritome, and a bed-like text file containing independent intron coordinates, and output intron retention events based on a set of criteria that filter for reliable IR events. These criteria involves the number of reads/fragments in intronic regions, FPKM, junction reads, read distribution patterns within an intron.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:27:15Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-11T09:56:39Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iREAD","home":"https://bio.tools/iread","summary":"A tool for intron retention detection from RNA-seq data.\n\niREAD (intron REtention Analysis and Detector)is a tool to detect intron retention(IR) events from RNA-seq datasets.
