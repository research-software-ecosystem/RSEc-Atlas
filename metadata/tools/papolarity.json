For a single sample, for each transcript papolarity allows for computing the classic polarity metric which, in the case of Ribo-Seq, reflects ribosome positional preferences. For comparison versus a control sample, papolarity estimates an improved metric, the relative linear regression slope of coverage along transcript length. This involves de-noising by profile segmentation with a Poisson model (using pasio), and aggregation of Ribo-Seq coverage within segments, thus achieving reliable estimates of the regression slope.","addition_date":"2021-11-01T10:35:09.355559Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:37:23.405174Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Papolarity","home":"https://bio.tools/papolarity","summary":"Papolarity is a Python package for analysis of transcript-level short read coverage profiles.
