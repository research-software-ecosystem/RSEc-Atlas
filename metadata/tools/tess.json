Additionally, the likelihood equations are implemented for convenience and can be used for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and Bayesian inference.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T19:02:41Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:21:47.895521Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TESS","home":"https://bio.tools/tess","summary":"An R-package for simulation of reconstructed phylogenetic trees under global, time-dependent birth-death processes.
