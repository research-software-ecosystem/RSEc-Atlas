Different solutions are  provided to compute a meta-kernel, in a consensus way or in a way that  best preserves the original topology of the data. mixKernel also integrates kernel PCA to visualize similarities between samples in a non linear space and from the multiple source point of view. Functions to assess and display important variables are also provided in the package. Jerome Mariette and  Nathalie Villa-Vialaneix (2017) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btx682>."}}}
