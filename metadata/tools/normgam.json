It implements five normalization methods, including normalized linkage disequilibrium (NLD), vanilla coverage (VC), sequential component normalization (SCN), iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition (ICE), and Knight-Ruiz 2-norm (KR2). The normalization procedure can remove known and unknown systematic biases, the known biases including window detection frequency, fragment length, mappability, and GC content.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:01:23Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T14:20:03Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"normGAM","home":"https://bio.tools/normgam","summary":"An R package to remove systematic biases in genome architecture mapping data.\n\nnormGAM is an R package for normalizing genome architecture mapping (GAM) data.
