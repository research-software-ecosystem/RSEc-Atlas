It thus provides providing facile access to a feature-rich, open-source algorithm library for mass-spectrometry based proteomics analysis. These Python bindings allow raw access to the data-structures and algorithms implemented in OpenMS, specifically those for file access (mzXML, mzML, TraML, mzIdentML among others), basic signal processing (smoothing, filtering, de-isotoping and peak-picking) and complex data analysis (including label-free, SILAC, iTRAQ and SWATH analysis tools)."}}}
