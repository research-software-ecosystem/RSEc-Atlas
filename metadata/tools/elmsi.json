ELMSI can estimate the specific length distributions and states of micro-satellite regions from a mixed tumor sample paired with a control one. It first estimated the purity of the tumor sample based on the read counts of the filtered SNVs loci. Then, the algorithm identified the length distributions and the states of short micro-satellites by adding the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) step to the existing algorithm.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:14:35Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-05T16:32:55Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ELMSI","home":"https://bio.tools/elmsi","summary":"ELMSI is a method for the detection of micro-satellite instability events based on the next generation sequencing technology.
