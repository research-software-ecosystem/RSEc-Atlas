Protein phosphoglycerylation is the reaction in which a 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (1,3-BPG) is attached to a lysine residue of a protein molecule, and thus to form a 3-phosphoglyceryl-lysine (pgK). Phosphoglycerylation is a reversible and non-enzymatic post-translational modification (PTM). It has been shown that the process of lysine phosphoglycerylation plays important regulatory roles in glucose metabolism and glycolytic process. However, studies in this field have been limited by the difficulty of experimentally identifying modified site specificity in lysine phosphoglycerylation (PGK).\n\nTo facilitate this process, several tools have been proposed for the computational identification of PGK sites.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:52:54Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-03T07:26:27Z","tool_type":["Web service"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iDPGK","home":"https://bio.tools/idpgk","summary":"Characterization and Identification of Lysine Phosphoglycerylation Sites Based on Sequence-Based Features.\n\niDPGK is a web server for identifying phosphoglycerylation sites.
