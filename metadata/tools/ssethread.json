Frequently, however, additional information is available from other biophysical experiments, physical principles, statistical analyses, and other prior models. Here, we formulate an integrative approach for sequence assignment to a partial backbone model as an optimization problem, which requires three main components: the representation of the system, the scoring function, and the optimization method.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:10:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-16T14:22:00Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SSEThread","home":"https://bio.tools/SSEThread","summary":"SSEThread  is an Integrative threading of the DNA-PKcs sequence based on data from chemical cross-linking and hydrogen deuterium exchange.\n\nX-ray crystallography and electron microscopy maps resolved to 3-8 \u00c5 are generally sufficient for tracing the path of the polypeptide chain in space, while often insufficient for unambiguously registering the sequence on the path (i.e., threading).
