The workflow performs all required pre-processing steps and quality control. Importantly, HRIBO outputs annotation-independent ORF predictions based on two complementary prokaryotic-focused tools, and integrates them with additional computed features. This facilitates both the rapid discovery of ORFs and their prioritization for functional characterization.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:29:36Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-01T08:40:35Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"HRIBO","home":"https://bio.tools/hribo","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"High-throughput analysis of bacterial ribosome profiling data.\n\nHigh-throughput annotation by Ribo-seq.\n\nWe present HRIBO (High-throughput annotation by Ribo-seq), a workflow to enable reproducible and high-throughput analysis of bacterial Ribo-seq data.
