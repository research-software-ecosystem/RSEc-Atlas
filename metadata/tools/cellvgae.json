CellVGAE uses the connectivity between cells (such as k-nearest neighbour graphs or KNN) with gene expression values as node features to learn high-quality cell representations in a lower-dimensional space, with applications in downstream analyses like (density-based) clustering, visualisation, gene set enrichment analysis and others. CellVGAE leverages both the variational graph autoencoder and graph attention networks to offer a powerful and more interpretable machine learning approach.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:18:14Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-10T20:27:10Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CellVGAE","home":"https://bio.tools/cellvgae","summary":"CellVGAE is an unsupervised scRNA-seq analysis workflow with graph attention networks.
