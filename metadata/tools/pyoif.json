The software is capable of simulating processes involving biological cells immersed in a fluid. The examples of such processes are flows in microfluidic channels with numerous applications such as cell sorting, rare cell isolation or flow fractionation. Besides the typical usage of such computational model in the design process of microfluidic devices, PyOIF has been used in the computer-aided discovery involving mechanical properties of cell membranes. With this software, single cell, many cell, as well as dense cell suspensions can be simulated. Many cell simulations include cell-cell interactions and analyse their effect on the cells","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:30:42Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-30T16:37:04Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PyOIF","home":"https://bio.tools/pyoif","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Computational tool for modelling of multi-cell flows in complex geometries.\n\nA user ready, well documented software package PyOIF contains an implementation of a robust validated computational model for cell flow modelling.
