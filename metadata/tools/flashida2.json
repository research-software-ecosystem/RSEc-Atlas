FLASHIda combines fast decharging algorithms in FLASHDeconv and machine learning-based quality assessment to identify optimal precursors for fragmentation. Currently the C# source code and instruction of FLASHIda is available in here under a BSD three-clause license. We are working on merging FLASHIda into OpenMS.","addition_date":"2023-09-30T19:58:13.012473Z","last_update_date":"2025-04-30T11:39:17.046987Z"}}}
