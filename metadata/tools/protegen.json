Protegen includes basic antigen information and experimental evidence curated from peer-reviewed articles. It also includes detailed gene/protein information (e.g. DNA and protein sequences, and COG classification). Different antigen features, such as protein weight and pI, and subcellular localizations of bacterial proteins are precomputed.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T12:32:26Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:53Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
