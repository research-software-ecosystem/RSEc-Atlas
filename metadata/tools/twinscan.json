In order to make its predictions, Twinscan combines the information from predicted coding regions and splice sites with conserservation measurements between the target sequence and sequences from a closely related genome. Currently sequences from mammalian genomes, and those of Arabidopsis thaliana, C. elegans, C. briggsae and strains JEC21 and H99 of Cryptococcus neoformans can be processed using Twinscan.","addition_date":"2017-05-02T10:00:47Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:01:31.850345Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Twinscan","home":"https://bio.tools/twinscan","summary":"Twinscan is a system for predicting gene-structure in eukaryotic genomic sequences.
