To quantify whether a gene could be a marker in a cell cluster, we can combine two Polar Gini Curves: one drawn upon the cell-points expressing the gene, and the other drawn upon all cell-points in the cluster. We hypothesize that the closers these two curves are, the more likely the gene would be cluster markers. We demonstrate the framework in several simulation case-studies.
