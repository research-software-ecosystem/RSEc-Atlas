The framework is meant to be interfaced to a large variety of external tools and software, including R and other libraries. It is also the first and at-present only scientific analysis tool to use reproducible builds via nix.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:04:37Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-22T14:22:39Z","tool_type":["Suite"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"d-SEAMS","home":"https://bio.tools/d-seams","summary":"d-SEAMS is a collection of analysis tools for molecular simulations.
