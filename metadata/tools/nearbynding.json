Input CLIP protein-binding data can either be in aligned BAM or peak-called BED/bedGraph formats. RNA structure can either be internally calculated via CapR or can be provided by the user as a BED/bedGraph. RNA structure binding profiles can be visually and mathematically compared between proteins across multiple formats.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:23:37Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T13:02:26Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"nearBynding","home":"https://bio.tools/nearbynding","license":"Artistic-2.0","summary":"A flexible pipeline characterizing protein binding to local RNA structure.\n\nnearBynding is an R package that discerns RNA structure at and proximal to the site of protein binding within regions of the transcriptome defined by the user.
