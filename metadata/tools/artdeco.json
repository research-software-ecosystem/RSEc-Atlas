ARTDeco functions to process a set of BAM files such that transcriptional readthrough can be quantified via a variety of measures including read-in levels, readthrough levels, downstream of gene (DoG) transcript detection, and inference of read-in genes. ARTDeco can also correct gene expression values by using read-in levels to deconvolute native gene expression and contribution from upstream readthrough transcription. ARTDeco works on both single-end and paired-end data, stranded and unstranded data, and forward and reverse strand oriented data.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:07:48Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-28T19:19:16Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ARTDeco","home":"https://bio.tools/artdeco","license":"MIT","summary":"ARTDeco is a pipeline for analyzing and characterizing transcriptional readthrough.
