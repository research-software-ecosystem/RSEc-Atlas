In the current study, we used machine learning algorithms to emulate computationally complex predictions in a reverse engineering-like manner and developed ContraDRG, a software that can be used to predict partial charges for small molecules based on PRODRG and Automated Topology Builder (ATB) predictions. Both tools generate molecular topology files, including the partial atomic charge, by using different procedures.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T08:58:38Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-16T17:51:17Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"ContraDRG","home":"https://bio.tools/ContraDRG","summary":"Automatic Partial Charge Prediction by Machine Learning.\n\nIn recent years, machine learning techniques have been widely used in biomedical research to predict unseen data based on models trained on experimentally derived data.
