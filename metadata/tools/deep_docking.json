While virtual screening can significantly enhance drug discovery workflow, it ultimately lags the current rate of expansion of chemical databases that already incorporate billions of purchasable compounds. This surge of available small molecules presents great opportunities for drug discovery but also demands for faster virtual screening methods and protocols.
