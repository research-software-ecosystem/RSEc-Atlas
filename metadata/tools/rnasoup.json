It requires as input a binary cluster-tree, the minimum free energy (MFE) of the consensus secondary structure for each internal node, and a FASTA file of the input sequences. It detects the optimal partition (i.e. finding the optimal number of clusters/groups) into distinct subtrees where each subtree contains structurally related RNA sequences.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:11:54Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0a"]}}}
