Specifically, core regions in two protein structures are first aligned by identifying connected components in a network of neighboring, geometrically compatible aligned fragment pairs (AFPs). The initial alignments then are refined through a multi-objective optimization method. The algorithm can produce both sequential and non-sequential alignments.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:59:02Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:22:44.916632Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SANA","home":"https://bio.tools/sana","summary":"An algorithm for the alignment of two proteins.
