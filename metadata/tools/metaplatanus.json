The features of this tool are as follows: (1) It can utilize various types of long-range information such as Oxford-Nanopore/PacBio long reads, mate-pairs (jumping libraries), and 10x linked reads (experimental). (2) Coverage depths, k-mer frequencies and results of the binning tool are also employed to extend sequences and correct mis-assemblies, reducing inter-species misassemblies. (3) Contig-assembly, scaffolding, gap-closing and binning are automatically executed at once. (4) MetaPlatanus requires at least one short-read paired-end library.","addition_date":"2022-02-17T11:51:44.012223Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:11:39.213845Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MetaPlatanus","home":"https://bio.tools/metaplatanus","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"MetaPlatanus is a de novo assembler for metagenome (microbiome).
