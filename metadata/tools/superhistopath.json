Here, we propose a computationally efficient framework (SuperHistopath), designed to map global context features reflecting the rich tumor morphological heterogeneity. SuperHistopath efficiently combines i) a segmentation approach using the linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixels algorithm applied directly on the whole-slide images at low resolution (5x magnification) to adhere to region boundaries and form homogeneous spatial units at tissue-level, followed by ii) classification of superpixels using a convolution neural network (CNN)\n\nCode is available by request.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:13:59Z","last_update_date":"2021-07-06T14:06:42Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SuperHistopath","home":"https://bio.tools/superhistopath","summary":"A Deep Learning Pipeline for Mapping Tumor Heterogeneity on Low-Resolution Whole-Slide Digital Histopathology Images.\n\nHigh computational cost associated with digital pathology image analysis approaches is a challenge towards their translation in routine pathology clinic.
