It uses the reversed association testing approach (like diffcyt) meaning the censored variable (e.g. survival time) is modeled as a predictor. Classical survival analysis methods on the other hand model the censored variable as the response.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:50:20Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-10T20:39:20Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"censcyt","home":"https://bio.tools/censcyt","license":"MIT","summary":"censcyt is an R package extending the diffcyt (differential discovery in high-dimensional cytometry via high-resolution clustering) pipeline. censcyt (Censored diffcyt) includes methods for differential abundance analysis in the presence of a covariate subject to right censoring.
