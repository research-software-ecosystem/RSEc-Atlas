It provides methods for the statistical analysis of ChIP-Seq data including inference of protein occupancy, and pointwise and region-wise differential analysis. Scaling of generalized additive model fitting to whole chromosomes is achieved by parallelization over overlapping genomic intervals.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T14:59:58Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:28:02.148601Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.2.1"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GenoGAM","home":"https://bio.tools/genogam","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.2.1","summary":"This package allows statistical analysis of genome-wide data with smooth functions using generalized additive models based on the implementation from the R-package 'mgcv'.
