Systematic comparisons shows that essHi-C improves the clarity of the interaction patterns, enhances the robustness against sequencing depth, allows the unsupervised clustering of experiments in different cell lines and recovers the cell-cycle phasing of single-cells based on Hi-C data. Thus, essHi-C provides means for isolating significant biological and physical features from Hi-C matrices.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:56:51Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-22T11:12:53Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"essHi-C","home":"https://bio.tools/esshi-c","license":"MIT","summary":"Essential component analysis of Hi-C matrices.\n\nHere we introduce essHi-C, a method to isolate the specific, or essential component of Hi-C matrices from the aspecific portion of the spectrum that is compatible with random matrices.
