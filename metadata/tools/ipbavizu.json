Comparison of 3D protein structures provides insight on their evolution and their functional specificities and can be done efficiently via protein structure superimposition analysis. Multiple approaches have been developed to perform such task and are often based on structural superimposition deduced from sequence alignment, which does not take into account structural features. Our methodology is based on the use of a Structural Alphabet (SA), i.e. a library of 3D local protein prototypes able to approximate protein backbone. The interest of a SA is to translate into 1D sequences into the 3D structures. Results:We used Protein blocks (PB), a widely used SA consisting of 16 prototypes, each representing a conformation of the pentapeptide skeleton defined in terms of dihedral angles.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:13:42Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-14T13:04:28Z","tool_type":["Plug-in"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"iPBAvizu","home":"https://bio.tools/iPBAvizu","summary":"A PyMOL plugin for an efficient 3D protein structure superimposition approach.\n\nBackground:Protein 3D structure is the support of its function.
