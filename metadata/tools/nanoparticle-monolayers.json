Such characterization is critical to nanoparticle biosensors, whose performance and characteristics are determined by the distribution of the underlying nanoparticle film.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:36:32Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-03T17:09:25Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"workflow characterizing nanoparticle monolayers biosensors","home":"https://bio.tools/nanoparticle-monolayers","summary":"A workflow for characterizing nanoparticle monolayers for biosensors.\n\nA persistent challenge in materials science is the characterization of a large ensemble of heterogeneous nanostructures in a set of images.
