The created atlases demonstrated structural variations in the spinal cord consistent with well-known anatomical characteristics. These atlases (in PAM50 space from Spinal Cord toolbox) can be used as a reference to demonstrate areas of abnormalities in individuals with myelin-related disease and damage.
