This package implements the procedures of Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. In addition to the standard measures for stress and force generation, it also includes the line tension, a measure for the force transfer exclusively across cell-cell boundaries. pyTFM includes an addon for the image annotation tool clickpoints allowing you to quickly analyze and vizualize large datasets.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:43:19Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-31T11:02:03Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"pyTFM","home":"https://bio.tools/pytfm","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"A tool for Traction Force and Monolayer Stress Microscopy.\n\npyTFM is a python package that allows you to analyze force generation and stresses in cells, cell colonies and confluent cell layers growing on a 2 dimensional surface.
