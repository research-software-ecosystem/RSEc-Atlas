It enables searches of conformational information across multiple structures. The database contains a wide variety of structural parameters and molecular images, computed with the 3DNA software package and known to be useful for characterizing and understanding the sequence-dependent spatial arrangements of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, sugar-base side groups, base pairs, base-pair steps, groove structure, etc.","addition_date":"2017-03-27T07:20:20Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:40Z","tool_type":["Database portal"]}}}
