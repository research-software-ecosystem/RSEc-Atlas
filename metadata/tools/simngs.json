By default, observations only incorporate noise due to sequencing and do not incorporate effects from more esoteric sources of noise that may be present in real data (\u201cdust\u201d, bubbles, merged clusters, sequence-heterogeneous clusters, etc). Many of these additional sources may optionally applied.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:15:40Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["20130502"]}}}
