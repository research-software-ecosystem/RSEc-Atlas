TransMeta can output a unified set of meta-annotations(GTF format) for all samples in an RNA-seq experiment and use the information from all the samples to generate a set of transcripts for each individual sample. TransMeta constructs the novel vector-weighted splicing graph model, in which the edges and nodes are weighted by vectors rather than single numbers with the element in kth position of the vectors being the corresponding weight in sample k. And TransMeta employs a cosine-similarity based combing strategy and label setting algorithm to recover the transcripts. TransMeta takes a file that lists the alignment files(Bam format) of multiple RNA-seq samples as input, and outputs all assembled candidate transcripts in GTF format.","addition_date":"2022-09-27T21:15:54.693781Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:34:53.770197Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TransMeta","home":"https://bio.tools/transmeta","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"TransMeta is an assembler that can simultaneously assemble RNA-seq reads of multiple samples.
