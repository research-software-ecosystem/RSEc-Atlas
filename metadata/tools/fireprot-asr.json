Fireprot-ASR allows you to perform ancestral sequence reconstruction starting from a single protein sequence. The pipeline first compiles a dataset of catalytically similar protein sequences, aligns them, construct their phylogenetic tree, and then reconstruct ancestral nodes. It also allows user to input their own data and start from a different point in the pipeline.","addition_date":"2020-05-14T06:12:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-24T12:44:14Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["1.1"],"collections":["Czech Republic","ELIXIR-CZ"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FireProt ASR","home":"https://bio.tools/fireprot-asr","license":"Proprietary","version":"1.1","summary":"FireProt-ASR is a web server for an automated calculation of ancestral sequences.
