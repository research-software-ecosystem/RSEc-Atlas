It contains functions to (1) define and transform genomic targets, (2) find spacers (4) count offtarget (mis)matches, and (5) compute Doench2016/2014 targeting efficiency. Care has been taken for multicrispr to scale well towards large target sets, enabling the design of large Crispr/Cas9 libraries."}}}
