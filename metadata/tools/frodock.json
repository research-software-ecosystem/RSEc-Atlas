This approximation effectively address the complexity and sampling requirements of the initial 6D docking exhaustive search by combining the projection of the interaction terms into 3D grid-based potentials with the efficiency of spherical harmonics approximations.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:43:09Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:45Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["2.1"]}}}
