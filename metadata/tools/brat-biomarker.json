The BRAT software uses a simple pharmacokinetic model to simulate exposure, internal levels, and resulting urinary levels in individuals from a population based on user-specified inputs (e.g., biological half-life, within- and between-person variability in exposure). Based on internal levels (a toxicologically-relevant exposure metric) and urinary levels in the simulated population, the tool evaluates \u2013 through linear regression and quantile classification \u2013 the accuracy of the estimation of internal levels depending on the number of urine samples.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:31:21Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-06T17:03:03Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BRAT","home":"https://bio.tools/brat-biomarker","summary":"The Biomarker Reliability Assessment Tool (BRAT) was developed to help researchers set targets to improve exposure assessment in studies of chemicals with a short half-life.
