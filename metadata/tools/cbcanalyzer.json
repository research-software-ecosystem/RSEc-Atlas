CTTransform reads several CT-file formats (ct, RNAviz ct or Mac ct), and generates a so called \u201cbracket-dot-bracket\u201d format that typically is used as input for other tools such as RNAforester, RNAmovie or MARNA. The latter one creates a multiple alignment based on primary sequences and secondary structures that now can be used as input for CBCDetect.

The count matrix obtained by CBCDetect is used as input for CBCTree.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:04:36Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]}}}
