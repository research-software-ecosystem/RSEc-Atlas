The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the basis for almost all biological processes. Hot spots are residues comprising only a small fraction of interfaces yet accounting for the majority of the binding energy. These residues are critical in understanding the principles of PPI.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:31:36Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-28T10:38:14Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PIIMS","home":"https://bio.tools/piims","summary":"A Web Server for Mutation Hotspot Scanning at the Protein-Protein Interface.\n\nThe PIIMS Server (Protein Interface In silico Mutation Scanning) was developed successfully to predict hot spots from interface of protein-protein complex by calculating the binding free energy changes upon alanine mutation scanning.
