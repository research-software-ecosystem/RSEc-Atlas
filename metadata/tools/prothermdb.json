Besides, the current version of the database includes ~0.12 million thermodynamic data obtained for different organisms and cell lines, which are determined by recent high throughput proteomics techniques using whole-cell approaches. In addition, we provided a graphical interface for the visualization of mutations at sequence and structure levels.
