Since analyzing the whole metabolic networks is not easy, network modulation is an important issue to be investigated. Decomposing metabolic networks is a strategy to obtain better insight into metabolic functions. Additionally, decomposing these networks facilitates using computational methods, which are very slow when applied to the original genome-scale network. Several methods have been proposed for decomposing of the metabolic network. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate these methods by suitable criteria.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:03:03Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-10T12:09:18Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"CAMND","home":"https://bio.tools/CAMND","summary":"Comparative analysis of metabolic network decomposition based on previous and two new criteria.\n\nMetabolic networks can model the behavior of metabolism in the cell.
