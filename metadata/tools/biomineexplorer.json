It is based on the results of the Biomine project that develops methods for the analysis of public biological data sources (annotated sequences, proteins, domains, and orthology groups, genes and gene expressions, gene and protein interactions, scientific articles, and ontologies). All information is handled as networks and Biomine provides probabilistic network search algorithms to automatically extract the most relevant subnetworks.\n\nThe most prominent feature of Biomine Explorer is interactive exploration of its large probabilistic networks by using an interactive network visualisation interface. Network editing features and private network repositories are also available as well as a repository of publicly available graphs. All links to Biomine graphs are permanent so they can be used in scientific publications or published on the web.","addition_date":"2020-06-30T11:51:56Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:58:38.256188Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["ELIXIR-SI"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Biomine Explorer","home":"https://bio.tools/BiomineExplorer","summary":"Biomine Explorer is a web application that enables interactive exploration of selected publicly available biological knowledge.
