This allows users to check for packing defects, which may be a sign of a wrongly resolved structure. The tool also helps in creating reliable simulations by finding cavities possibly missing internal water molecules in the structure, thereby enabling a more realistic modeling of proteins and nucleic acids. The results are visualized directly on the website with NGL. Voronoia also includes a database of precalculated structures from the Protein Data Bank which can be explored.","addition_date":"2021-10-06T14:37:10.898573Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-10T11:46:35.993778Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Voronoia","home":"https://bio.tools/voronoia","license":"Not licensed","summary":"Voronoia is a web tool which identifies cavities in a molecular structure and calculates the packing density of all atoms.
