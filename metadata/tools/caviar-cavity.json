CAVIAR is an open source tool for protein cavity identification and rationalization, written in python and available as command line and as a GUI.

These subcavities reproduce subpockets as defined empirically with medicinal chemistry knowledge.","addition_date":"2021-06-14T13:36:39Z","last_update_date":"2021-08-19T19:08:11Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CAVIAR","home":"https://bio.tools/caviar-cavity","license":"MIT","summary":"Cavity Identification And Rationalization (CAVIAR) is a method for automatic cavity detection, description and decomposition into subcavities.
