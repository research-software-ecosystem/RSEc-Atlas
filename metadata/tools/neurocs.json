Accurate identification of cleavage sites of neuropeptide precursors is of great significance for the development of neuroscience and brain science. OBJECTIVE:With the explosive growth of neuropeptide precursor data, it is pretty much needed to develop bioinformatics methods for predicting neuropeptide precursors' cleavage sites quickly and efficiently. METHOD:We started with processing the neuropeptide precursor data from SwissProt and NueoPedia into two sets of data, training dataset and testing dataset. Subsequently, six feature extraction schemes were applied to generate different feature sets and then feature selection methods were used to find the optimal feature set of each","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:09:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T07:59:58Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"NeuroCS","home":"https://bio.tools/NeuroCS","summary":"A Tool to Predict Cleavage Sites of Neuropeptide Precursors.\n\nBACKGROUND:Neuropeptides are a class of bioactive peptides produced from neuropeptide precursors through a series of extremely complex processes, mediating neuronal regulations in many aspects.
