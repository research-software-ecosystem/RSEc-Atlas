Discrete and continuous formulations are efficiently coupled in one model and allow considerations on different scales: sub-cellular, cellular and tissue scale.\nHigh parallel scalability achieved allows simulation of up to 109 individual cells. This large scale computational approach allows for simulations to be carried out over realistic spatial scales up to 1cm in size i.e. the tissue scale.","addition_date":"2022-04-22T14:21:02.581209Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T15:12:39.365866Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["0.9"],"collections":["PerMedCoE"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Timothy","home":"https://bio.tools/timothy","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"0.9","summary":"Timothy is a novel large scale parallel computational model allowing 3-D simulations of cell colonies growing and interacting with variable environment in previously unavailable tissue scale.\nThe cells are modeled as individuals located in the lattice-free 3-D space.
