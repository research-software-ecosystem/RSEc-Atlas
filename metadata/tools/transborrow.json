To effectively analyze RNA-seq data, we introduce a novel transcriptome assembler, TransBorrow, which borrows the assemblies from different assemblers to search for reliable subsequences by building a colored graph from those borrowed assemblies. Then, by seeding reliable subsequences, a newly designed path extension strategy accurately searches for a transcript-representing path cover over each splicing graph. TransBorrow was tested on both simulated and real data sets and showed great superiority over all the compared leading assemblers","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:38:04Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-02T11:50:00Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TransBorrow","home":"https://bio.tools/transborrow","summary":"genome-guided transcriptome assembly by borrowing assemblies from different assemblers.\n\nRNA-seq technology is widely used in various transcriptomic studies and provides great opportunities to reveal the complex structures of transcriptomes.
