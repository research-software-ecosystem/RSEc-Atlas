THE WID_clocks function uses a methylation beta matrix and returns the WID general, epithelial and immune clocks. It also returns the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID_rea) and WID-relative-immune-age (WID_ria) (\u2206WID epithelial or WID immune and WID general clock). \nhttps://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02603-3","addition_date":"2025-06-12T12:15:54.832306Z","last_update_date":"2025-06-12T12:15:54.834519Z"}}}
