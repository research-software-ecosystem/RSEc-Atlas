Haplotypes play a crucial role in many analyses, including genome-wide association studies and population genetics. Haplotype reconstruction becomes more difficult for higher numbers of homologous chromosomes, as it is often the case for polyploid plants. This complexity is compounded further by higher heterozygosity, which denotes the frequent presence of variants between haplotypes. We have designed Ranbow, a new tool for haplotype reconstruction of polyploid genome from short read sequencing data. Ranbow integrates all types of small variants in bi- and multi-allelic sites to reconstruct haplotypes. To evaluate Ranbow and currently available competing methods on real data, we have created and released a real gold standard dataset from sweet potato sequencing data","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:13:23Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-03T14:06:34Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Ranbow","home":"https://bio.tools/ranbow","summary":"A fast and accurate method for polyploid haplotype reconstruction.\n\nReconstructing haplotypes from sequencing data is one of the major challenges in genetics.
