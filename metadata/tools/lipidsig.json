LipidSig is the first web-based platform which integrates a comprehensive analysis for streamlined data mining of lipidomic datasets. The user-friendly interface provides five main functions, namely Profiling, Differential expression, Machine learning, Correlation and Network, for assessment of lipid effects on biological mechanisms. The five functions provide unique aspects to analyze the lipidome profiling data based on different characteristics including lipid class, chain length, unsaturation, hydroxyl group, and fatty acid composition.', In summary, LipidSig enables users to perform intensive lipid analysis and create interactive plots with downloadable images and corresponding tables.","addition_date":"2021-10-04T11:55:15.595858Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-04T11:55:15.598127Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"LipidSig","home":"https://bio.tools/lipidsig","summary":"LipidSig is a web-based tool for lipidomic data analysis.
