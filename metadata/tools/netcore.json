NetCore addresses the node degree bias in PPI networks by using node coreness in the random walk with restart procedure, and achieves better re-ranking of genes after propagation. Furthermore, NetCore implements a semi-supervised approach to identify network modules, which include both well-known genes together with new candidates.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:20:49Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T13:36:41Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"NetCore","home":"https://bio.tools/netcore","summary":"A network propagation approach using node coreness.\n\nNetwork propagation using node coreness and a semi-supervised approach for module identification.\n\nNetCore is a network propagation approach based on node coreness, for phenotype- genotype associations and module identification.
