MDock is an automated molecular docking software which can simultaneously docking ligands against multiple protein structures/conformations by using the ensemble docking algorithm. It supports docking/optimizing ligand(s) against either a single protein structure or an ensemble of multiple protein structures and score calculations for given protein-ligand complexes. The energy function used in MDock is the knowledge-based scoring function, ITScore.","addition_date":"2021-10-09T18:24:06.967367Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-09T18:24:06.970354Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"MDock","home":"https://bio.tools/mdock","summary":"MDock is a suite for molecular inverse docking and target prediction.
