MOG overcomes the challenges posed by big size and complexity of big datasets by efficient handling of data files by using a combination of data indexing and buffering schemes. By incorporating metadata, MOG adds another dimension to the analyses and provides flexibility in data exploration. MOG allows users to explore their own data on their local machines.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:02:05Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-22T08:01:51Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MOG","home":"https://bio.tools/mog","license":"MIT","summary":"A workbench for interactive exploratory data analysis of large expression datasets.\n\nMetaOmGraph (MOG) is a Java software to interactively explore and visualize large datasets.
