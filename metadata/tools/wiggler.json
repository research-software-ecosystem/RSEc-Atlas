Allows pooling of replicate datasets while allowing for replicate and data-type specific read shifting and smoothing parameters. It can be used to generate signal density maps for ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq and MNase-seq data. Wiggler also implicitly models variability in mappability to appropriately normalize signal density and distinguish missing data from true zero signal.","addition_date":"2017-08-20T15:59:20Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:04:52.967371Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["Animal and Crop Genomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Wiggler","home":"https://bio.tools/wiggler","license":"MIT","summary":"Produces normalized genome-wide signal coverage tracks from raw read alignment files.
