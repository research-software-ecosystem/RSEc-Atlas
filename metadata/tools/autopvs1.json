In 2018, the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) Working Group refined the only criterion (PVS1) for pathogenicity in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG AMP) guidelines. The refinement may improve interpretation consistency, but it also brings hurdles to biocurators because of the complicated workflows and multiple bioinformatics sources required. To address these issues, we developed an automatic classification tool called AutoPVS1 to streamline PVS1 interpretation. We assessed the performance of AutoPVS1 using 56 variants manually curated by ClinGen\u2019s SVI Working Group and achieved an interpretation concordance of 95% (53 56)","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:18:22Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:57:06.446110Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"AutoPVS1","home":"https://bio.tools/AutoPVS1","summary":"An automatic classification tool for PVS1 interpretation of null variants | Abstract Null variants are prevalent within human genome, and their accurate interpretation is critical for clinical management.
