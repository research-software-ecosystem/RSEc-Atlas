The functional analysis module, which includes the popular Blast2GO annotation methodology makes OmicsBox particularly suited for non-model organism research.","addition_date":"2023-06-16T10:13:21.862538Z","last_update_date":"2023-06-16T10:13:21.866350Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["3.0"],"collections":["OmicsBox"]}}}
