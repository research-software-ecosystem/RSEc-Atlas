We propose a novel machine learning method for predicting unknown DDIs called \"NDD\", using a two-layer fully connected neural network. NDD uses various characteristics of drugs to have comprehensive information. Multiple drug similarities are calculated. NDD integrat various drug similarities with a non-linear similarity fusion method called \"SNF\" to achieve high-level features.
