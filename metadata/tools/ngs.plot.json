The signature advantage of this tool is that it collects a large database of functional elements for many genomes. A user can ask for a functionally important region to be displayed in one command. It handles large sequencing data efficiently and has only modest memory requirement.","addition_date":"2017-01-13T13:15:41Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
