It is capable of detecting novel STR expansions, that is expansions where there is no STR in the reference genome at that position (or a different repeat unit from what is in the reference). It can also detect STR expansions that are annotated in the reference genome. STRling uses kmer counting to recover mis-mapped STR reads. It then uses soft-clipped reads to precisely discover the position of the STR expansion in the reference genome.","addition_date":"2021-04-22T01:24:48Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-22T14:47:03Z","version":["v0.4.2"]}}}
