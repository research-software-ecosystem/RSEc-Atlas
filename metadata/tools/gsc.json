OBJECTIVE:To compare statistical and machine learning algorithms in their ability to predict survival in GBM patients and deploy the best performing model as an online survival calculator. METHODS:Patients undergoing an operation for a histopathologically confirmed GBM were extracted from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2005-2015) and split into a training and hold-out test set in an 80 20 ratio","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:22:34Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:57:01.582143Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GSC","home":"https://bio.tools/gsc","summary":"An Online Calculator for the Prediction of Survival in Glioblastoma Patients Using Classical Statistics and Machine Learning.\n\nBACKGROUND:Although survival statistics in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are well-defined at the group level, predicting individual patient survival remains challenging because of significant variation within strata.
