{"tool_name":"physigs","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"PhySigs","home":"https://github.com/elkebir-group/PhySigs","summary":"PhySigs uses the input of a phylogeny with nodes representing clones in a patient tumor, a signature matrix containing the set of mutational signatures to use in the analysis, and a feature matrix for the set of mutations introduced in each clone. In particular, the mutational categories in the feature matrix should correspond to the mutational categories used in the signature matrix. \nPhySigs automatically computes the count matrix, as it is simply a diagonal matrix containing the sum of columns in the feature matrix. PhySigs then solves the Tree-constrained Exposure (TE) problem for all possible clusterings of the clones that correspond to a partition of the phylogeny. The output of the TE problem is a relative exposure matrix composed of groups of identical columns corresponding to clusters of clones with identical exposures (denoted by blue and yellow). Edges between these clusters in the phylogeny are interpreted to be where exposure shifts occurred (denoted by a lightning bolt).","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:48:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-10T12:26:40Z"}}}
