It consists of demultiplexing, adaptor trimming, mapping, peak calling, cell calling, signal generating and quality controlling modules. The downstream analysis is comprised of dimension reduction, cell clustering, differential accessibility analysis, TF motif enrichment analysis and footprinting analysis.
