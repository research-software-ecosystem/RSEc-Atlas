We suggest to search lambda1 and lambda2 in the ranges of (0, 1) and (0, 10), respectively. With lambda1 and lambda2, run mirPLS to select miRNAs linearly or non-linearly associated with disease outcomes. Finally, run sp_clustering to conduct spectral clustering on patients using the selected non-linearly associated miRNAs. In the whole process, cv_mirPLS are time consuming. It may take hours to run the whole process for a typical miRNA data from TCGA.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:52:30Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-24T08:17:41Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"mirPLS","home":"https://bio.tools/mirpls","summary":"A partial linear structure identifier method for cancer subtyping using microRNAs.\n\nThe R package for \u2018mirPLS: a partial linear structure identifier method for cancer subtyping using MicroRNAs\u2019.\n\nRun cv_mirPLS to determine the regularization parameters: lambda1 and lambda2.
