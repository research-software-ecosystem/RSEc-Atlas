For each base in each read this walker calculates various user-specified covariates (such as read group, reported quality score, cycle, and dinuc) Using these values as a key in a large hashmap the walker calculates an empirical base quality score and overwrites the quality score currently in the read. This walker then outputs a new bam file with these updated (recalibrated) reads.","addition_date":"2016-12-19T14:23:50Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:30:18.408182Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["2.4-9"],"collections":["galaxyPasteur","gatk"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"gatk_print_reads","home":"https://bio.tools/gatk_print_reads","version":"2.4-9","summary":"This walker is designed to work as the second pass in a two-pass processing step, doing a by-read traversal.
