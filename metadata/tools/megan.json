MEGAN is a tool for studying the taxonomic content of a set of DNA reads, typically collected in a metagenomics project.In a preprocessing step, a sequence alignment of all reads against a suitable database of reference DNA or proteinsequences must be performed to produce an input file for the program. MEGAN is suitable for DNA reads (metagenomedata), RNA reads (metatranscriptome data), peptide sequences (metaproteomics data) and, using a suitable synonymsfile that maps SILVA ids to taxon ids, for 16S rRNA data (amplicon sequencing).","edam_operations":["Sequence analysis","Taxonomic classification"],"edam_topics":["Sequence analysis"],"toolshed_categories":["Sequence Analysis"],"toolshed_id":"megan","users_5_years":214,"users_all_time":214,"usage_5_years":4619,"usage_all_time":4619,"bio_tools_summary":"Metagenome Analysis Software - MEGAN (MEtaGenome ANalyzer\u009d) is a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic datasets.
