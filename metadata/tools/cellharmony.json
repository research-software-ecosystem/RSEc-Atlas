We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:44:49Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-10T15:26:04Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"cellHarmony","home":"https://bio.tools/cellHarmony","summary":"Cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes | To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed.
