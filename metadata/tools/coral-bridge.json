The core of Coral is a optimization formulation that can capture the most reliable bridging path while also filter out false paths. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is designed to calculate the top N optimum. Coral implements a consensus approach to select the best solution among the N candidates by taking into account the distribution of fragment length. Coral is modular, can be easily incorporated into existing RNA-seq analysis pipeline.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:01:53Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-11T14:13:58Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Coral","home":"https://bio.tools/coral-bridge","license":"BSD-3-Clause","summary":"Coral is a tool that can accurately bridge paired-end RNA-seq reads.
