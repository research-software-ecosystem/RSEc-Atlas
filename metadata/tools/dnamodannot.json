It can be used for DNA modification filtering and annotation using long-read sequencing data. DNAModAnnot is a R package providing a comprehensive toolkit for the genome-wide analysis and annotation of DNA modifications (Mod) (e.g. 6-methyladenine (6mA) or 5-methylcytosine (5mC)). Its modular architecture allows the analysis of Mod detection performed using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) kineticsTools or Oxford Nanopore Technologies via DeepSignal software. DNAModAnnot also provides customized visualization functions to describe DNA modification patterns.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:28:08Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-10T09:46:40Z","tool_type":["Suite"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DNAModAnnot","home":"https://bio.tools/dnamodannot","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"DNAModAnnot is a R toolbox for DNA modification filtering and annotation.
