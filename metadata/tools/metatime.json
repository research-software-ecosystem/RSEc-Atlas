Data driven framework to overcome the limitations in resolution and consistency that result from manual labelling using known gene markers. Using millions of TME single cells, MetaTiME learns meta-components that encode independent components of gene expression observed across cancer types. The meta-components are biologically interpretable as cell types, cell states, and signaling activities. By projecting onto the MetaTiME space, we provide a tool to annotate cell states and signature continuums for TME scRNA-seq data.","addition_date":"2024-06-18T14:22:42.087375Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T13:54:04.234815Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MetaTiME","home":"https://bio.tools/metatime","summary":"Meta-components of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment.
