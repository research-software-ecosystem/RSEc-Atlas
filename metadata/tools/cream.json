'CREAM' uses genome-wide maps of genomic regions in the tissue or cell type of interest, such as those generated from chromatin-based assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq. 'CREAM' considers proximity of the elements within chromosomes of a given sample to identify COREs in the following steps: 1) It identifies window size or the maximum allowed distance between the elements within each CORE, 2) It identifies number of elements which should be clustered as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest order which does not pass the threshold considered in the approach","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:45:10Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-16T19:12:51Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CREAM","home":"https://bio.tools/CREAM","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Identifying clusters of cis-regulatory elements underpinning TAD structures and lineage-specific regulatory networks | Clustering of Genomic Regions Analysis Method | Provides a new method for identification of clusters of genomic regions within chromosomes.
