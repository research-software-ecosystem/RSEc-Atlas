OPT uses visible light to visualize the 3D morphology of large transparent samples. To enable a wider application of OPT, we present OptiJ, a low-cost, fully open-source OPT system capable of imaging large transparent specimens up to 13 mm tall and 8 mm deep with 50 \u00b5m resolution. OptiJ is based on off-the-shelf, easy-to-assemble optical components and an ImageJ plugin library for OPT data reconstruction. The software includes novel correction routines for uneven illumination and sample jitter in addition to CPU GPU accelerated reconstruction for large datasets. We demonstrate the use of OptiJ to image and reconstruct cleared lung lobes from adult mice.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T09:21:11Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T14:17:18Z","tool_type":["Plug-in"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OptiJ","home":"https://bio.tools/OptiJ","summary":"Open-source optical projection tomography of large organ samples.\n\nThe three-dimensional imaging of mesoscopic samples with Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) has become a powerful tool for biomedical phenotyping studies.
