Lancet uses a localized micro-assembly strategy to detect somatic mutation with high sensitivity and accuracy on a tumor/normal pair. Lancet is based on the colored de Bruijn graph assembly paradigm where tumor and normal reads are jointly analyzed within the same graph. On-the-fly repeat composition analysis and self-tuning k-mer strategy are used together to increase specificity in regions characterized by low complexity sequences. Lancet requires the raw reads to be aligned with BWA (See BWA description for more info). Lancet is implemented in C++.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:09:00Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-12T11:13:37Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Lancet","home":"https://bio.tools/lancet","summary":"Somatic variant analysis of linked-reads sequencing data with Lancet.\n\nLancet is a somatic variant caller (SNVs and indels) for short read data.
