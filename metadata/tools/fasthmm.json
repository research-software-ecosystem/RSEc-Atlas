FastHMM uses PSI-BLAST to quickly select likely members of the family and then uses HMMer to confirm those hits. FastBLAST relies on alignments of proteins to known families from FastHMM and from rpsblast against COG. FastBLAST uses these alignments to avoid most of the work of all-versus-all BLAST. FastBLAST further reduces the work by clustering similar sequences.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:06:27Z","last_update_date":"2019-03-13T13:01:56Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"collections":["BLAST","HMMER"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FastHMM","home":"https://bio.tools/fasthmm","summary":"FastHMM and FastBLAST are fast heuristics to replace HMM search, InterProScan, and all-versus-all BLAST.
