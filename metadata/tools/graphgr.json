It utilizes heterogeneous data to construct a graph for each cell-line-drug combination (instance). The trained model can be used to predict the effect (currently a binary classification) of a drug on a given cell line.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T08:58:05Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-25T09:46:18Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GraphGR","home":"https://bio.tools/graphgr","summary":"A graph neural network to predict the effect of pharmacotherapy on the cancer cell growth.\n\nGraphGR is a tool to predict drug (kinase inhibitors ONLY for now) response on a specific cell line given genetic information of the cell line, binding affinity of the drug to the proteins, and the disease association scores of the proteins.
