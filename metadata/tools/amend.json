It makes use of random walk with restart (RWR) to create node weights, and a heuristic approach for solving the Maximum-weight Connected Subgraph problem using these weights. The resulting subnetwork is then scored based on average experimental values and connectivity, and it is used as input into RWR for the next iteration. This process is performed iteratively until an optimal subnetwork (i.e., module) is found.","addition_date":"2024-03-27T20:35:20.553995Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:06:03.922708Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"AMEND","home":"https://bio.tools/amend","summary":"AMEND (Active Module identification using Experimental data and Network Diffusion) is an algorithm designed to find a subset of connected nodes in a molecular interaction network that have large experimental values.
