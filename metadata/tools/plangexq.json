PlanGexQ allows any user to define reference morphologies using mathematical graphs and a drag-and-drop interface. Gene expression pattern images can be uploaded to the program and then registered into the reference morphologies. Annotations with terms from the planarian anatomy ontology are autommatically created by analyzing the gene expression patterns and their textual descriptions. PlanGexQ represents a complete methodology for centralizing with formal and annotated descriptions the morphologies and gene expression patterns of planarian worms.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:07:46Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-24T07:22:26Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"PlanGexQ","home":"https://bio.tools/plangexq","summary":"PlanGexQ is a user-friendly interactive tool for the curation and annotation of planarian morphologies and gene expression patterns in a centralized database.
