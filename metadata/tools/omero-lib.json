Here, we propose an approach based on principles of Service Oriented Architecture design, to allow the integrated management and analysis of multi-omics and biomedical imaging data. The proposed architecture introduces an interoperable image management system, the OMERO server, into the backend of qPortal, a FAIR-compliant web-based platform for omics data management.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:20:17Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-04T13:21:37Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"OMERO-lib","home":"https://bio.tools/omero-lib","summary":"Efficient data management infrastructure for the integration of imaging and omics data in life science research.\n\nAbstract As technical developments in omics and biomedical imaging drive the increase in quality, modality, and throughput of data generation in life sciences, the need for information systems capable of integrative, long-term storage and management of these heterogeneous digital assets is also increasing.
