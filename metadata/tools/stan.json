The tool implements (bidirectional) hidden Markov models (HMMs) using a variety of different probability distributions, which can model a wide range of current genomic data. It de novo learns and annotates the genome into a given number of 'genomic states'. It also allows for the integration of strand-specific and non-strand-specific data.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T14:59:51Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-10T15:57:04Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["2.2.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"STAN","home":"https://bio.tools/stan","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"2.2.0","summary":"Genome segmentation with hidden Markov models has become a useful tool to annotate genomic elements, such as promoters and enhancers.
