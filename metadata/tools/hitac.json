Moreover, fungi naturally inhabit the human microbiome and can be causative agents of human infections. An accurate and robust method for fungal ITS classification is not only desired for the purpose of better diversity estimation, but it can also help us gain a deeper insight of the dynamics of environmental communities and ultimately comprehend whether the abundance of certain species correlate with health and disease. Although many methods have been proposed for taxonomic classification, to the best of our knowledge, none of them consider the taxonomic tree hierarchy when building their models.
