Research in spatial epidemiology and earth observation is helping academics to understand and prioritise how mortality could be reduced and generates spatial data that are used at a global and national level, to inform disease control policy. These data could also inform operational decision making at a more local level, for example to help officials target efforts at a local regional level. To be usable for local decision-making, data needs to be presented in a way that is relevant to and understandable by local decision makers. We demonstrate an approach and prototype web application to make spatial outputs from disease modelling more useful for local decision making.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:34:41Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-22T14:11:17Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Malaria Data District","home":"https://bio.tools/Malaria_Data_District","summary":"An open-source web application for increasing access to malaria information.\n\nPreventable diseases still cause huge mortality in low- and middle-income countries.
