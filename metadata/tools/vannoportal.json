It greatly expands context-dependent variant annotation to incorporate large-scale epigenomic maps across human tissues/cell types, and compiles many genome-scale base-wise prediction scores for pathogenic/regulatory variant classification beyond protein-coding region. VannoPortal focuses more on interpretability of variant annotations using many intuitive visualizations and interactive web components.","addition_date":"2022-01-21T00:36:19.447838Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:12:52.589391Z","tool_type":["Database portal","Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"VannoPortal","home":"https://bio.tools/vannoportal","summary":"VannoPortal is a variant annotation database that comprehensively collects and integrates genome-wide variant annotations and prediction scores from various biological domains, including allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, evolutionary signature, disease/trait association, pathogenesis, allele imbalance, base-wise functional prediction and tissue/cell type-specific functional profile.
