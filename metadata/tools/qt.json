Several algorithms have been designed and optimized to perform this routine task and among them, Quality Threshold (QT) stands as a very attractive option. QT guarantees that in retrieved clusters, no pair of frames will have a similarity value greater than a specified threshold and hence a set of strongly correlated frames is obtained for each cluster.
