This tool extracts weekly updated 3D complexes of antibody-antigen, TCR-pMHC and MHC-ligand from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and clusters them based on antigens, receptors and epitopes to generate benchmark datasets. Users can customize structural quality and clustering parameters (e.g. resolution, R free factors, antigen or epitope sequence identity) to generate these datasets based on their need.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:37:14Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-16T12:59:08Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"SCEptRe","home":"https://bio.tools/SCEptRe","summary":"SCEptRe provides weekly updated, non-redundant, user customized benchmark datasets with information on the immune receptor features for receptor-specific epitope predictions.
