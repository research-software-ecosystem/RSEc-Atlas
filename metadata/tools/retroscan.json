It scans retrocopies based on alignments between protein-coding genes and whole-genome sequences. This tool can also analyze heterosense substitution and synonymous substitution, compare gene structure between parental genes and retrocopies, and calculate corresponding expression values. Moreover, RetroScan has a user-friendly visualization interface that provides overall statistical information, a retrocopy structure diagram, the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution (Ka/Ks) ratio distribution and the fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) heatmap using the Shiny package in R.","addition_date":"2022-02-06T21:38:13.948931Z","last_update_date":"2022-02-06T21:38:13.951608Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"RetroScan","home":"https://bio.tools/retroscan","license":"MIT","summary":"RetroScan is an easy-to-use tool for retrocopy identification that integrates a series of bioinformatics tools (LAST, BEDtools, ClustalW2, KaKs_Calculator, HISAT2, StringTie, SAMtools and Shiny) and scripts.
