Combined with evaluation results of tools like remuRNA and RNAsnp, MutaRNA enables a detailed evaluation of a mutation's effects on RNA structure formation.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:03:39Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-02T08:28:31Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MutaRNA","home":"https://bio.tools/mutarna","summary":"Analysis and visualization of mutation-induced changes in RNA structure.\n\nMutaRNA (Mutational Analysis of RNAs) predicts and visualizes the mutation-induced structure changes of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an RNA sequence.
