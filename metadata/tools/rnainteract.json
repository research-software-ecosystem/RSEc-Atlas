The screen is assumed to be performed in multi-well plates or similar designs. Starting from a list of features (e.g. cell number, area, fluorescence intensity) per well, genetic interactions are estimated. The packages provides functions for reporting interacting gene pairs, plotting heatmaps and double RNAi plots.
