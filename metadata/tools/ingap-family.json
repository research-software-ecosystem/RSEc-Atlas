Applying this method on polymorphism detection on real datasets shows that elimination of artificial variants greatly facilitates the precise identification of meiotic recombination points, recognizing causal mutations in mutant genomes or QTL loci. In addition, inGAP-family provides user-friendly graphical interface for detection of polymorphisms and structural variants, and for further evaluation of predicted variants and identification of mutations related to genotypes.","addition_date":"2021-09-28T17:48:35.611567Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:18:53.119013Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Desktop application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"inGAP-family","home":"https://bio.tools/ingap-family","summary":"inGAP-family is a tool for accurate detection of meiotic recombination loci and causal mutations by filtering out artificial variants due to genome complexities. inGAP-family provides an efficient and effective framework to discover, filter and visualize DNA polymorphisms and structural variants from alignment of short reads.
