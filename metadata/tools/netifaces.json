There is a good reason for this difficulty, which is that it is virtually impossible to do so in a portable manner. However, it seems to me that there should be a package you can easy_install that will take care of working out the details of doing so on the machine you are using, then you can get on with writing Python code without concerning yourself with the nitty gritty of system-dependent low-level networking APIs."}}}
