It is a web server for data normalization and unsupervised clustering based on expression profiles. This tool is composed of 3 unsupervised machine learning algorithms: Mean Shift, K-Means and Hierarchical. Unsupervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe the hidden structure from unlabeled data. The inductor analyzes the examples provided and tries to determine if some of them can be grouped in any way, forming clusters.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:50:06Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-17T15:17:57Z","tool_type":["Web application"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"CORAZON","home":"https://bio.tools/corazon","summary":"CORAZON( CORrelations Analyses Zipper ONline) is a bioinformatic tool that uses artificial intelligence to cluster genes according to their expression in tissues and also a tool to normalize databases.
