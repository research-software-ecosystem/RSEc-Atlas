The tool is used to merge structural variants (SVs) across samples. Each sample has a number of SV calls, consisting of position information (chromosome, start, end, length), type and strand information, and a number of other values. Jasmine represents the set of all SVs across samples as a network, and uses a modified minimum spanning forest algorithm to determine the best way of merging the variants such that each merged variants represents a set of analogous variants occurring in different samples.","addition_date":"2021-10-04T08:06:10.058660Z","last_update_date":"2021-10-04T08:06:10.061166Z","tool_type":["Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Jasmine","home":"https://bio.tools/jasmine-sv","license":"MIT","summary":"JASMINE (Jointly Accurate Sv Merging with Intersample Network Edges) is an automated pipeline for alignment and SV calling in long-read datasets.
