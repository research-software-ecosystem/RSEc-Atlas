We evaluated VirusSeq on RNA-Seq data of 256 TCGA human cancer samples. Using these data, we showed that VirusSeq accurately detects the known viruses and their integration sites with high sensitivity and specificity. VirusSeq can also perform this function using whole genome sequencing data of human tissue.","addition_date":"2017-01-13T13:17:02Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:28:27.075739Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"VirusSeq","home":"https://bio.tools/virusseq","summary":"We developed a new algorithmic method, VirusSeq, for detecting known viruses and their integration sites in the human genome using next-generation sequencing data.
