The goal is to allow researchers and neuroscientists to easily make use of the analysis steps for real-time brain reconstruction using hdEEG. Our toolbox will contribute to source-based neurofeedback experiments and to development of novel BCI applications based on hdEEG. Through RT-NET, it is possible to enable source-based neurofeedback experiments in one or two brain areas, and to visualize in 2D and 3D (on a 3D cortical model) the online brain activity.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:04:51Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-08T13:51:45Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"RT-NET","home":"https://bio.tools/rt-net","summary":"real-time reconstruction of neural activity using high-density electroencephalography.\n\nRT-NET (real-time non-invasive electrophysiology toolbox), is a new software which can be used for online neural activity reconstruction from hdEEG.
