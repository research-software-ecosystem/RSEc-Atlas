The scan statistic will depend on a sequence of window sizes and on a threshold for each window size. This threshold can be calculated by three different means: i) analytically using Siegmund solution, ii) an important sampling as suggested by Zhang, and a iii) full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing between a number of different options for modeling the dependency between each CpG.","addition_date":"2018-07-08T13:08:32Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.6.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
