Nabo provides data implicit methods of verifying mapping quality, this allows users to clearly infer similarities between sub-populations across samples.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:26:05Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T08:28:07Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Nabo","home":"https://bio.tools/nabo","license":"BSD-3-Clause","summary":"Nabo \u2013 a framework to define leukemia-initiating cells and differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data.\n\nNabo is a flexible Python package that allows projections of cells from one population to another using single-cell RNA-Seq data.
