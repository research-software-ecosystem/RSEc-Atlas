Cross-domain categorisation and discovery of digital resources related to sensitive data presents major interoperability challenges. \n\nTo support the FAIRification process, a toolbox demonstrator aiming at improving the discovery of digital objects related to sensitive data (e.g., regulations, guidelines, best practice, tools) has been developed. The toolbox is based upon a categorisation system developed and harmonised across a cluster of 6 life science research infrastructures (ECRIN, EATRIS, BBMRI, ERINHA, EMBRC, Euro-BioImaging).\n\n3 different versions were built, tested by subsequent pilot studies, finally leading to a system with 7 main categories (sensitive data type, resource type, research field, data type, stage in data sharing life cycle, geographical scope, specific topics).","addition_date":"2023-08-08T09:57:20.872045Z","last_update_date":"2023-08-08T09:57:41.234362Z"}}}
