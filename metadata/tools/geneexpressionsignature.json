Gene expression signature is represented as a list of genes whose expression is correlated with a biological state of interest. Its distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance can be used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs, diseases, and biological states of interest.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:03:17Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:35:44.930420Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.20.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GeneExpressionSignature","home":"https://bio.tools/geneexpressionsignature","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.20.0","summary":"This package implements the gene expression signature and its distance to each.
