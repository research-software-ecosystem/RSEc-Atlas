FlyBrainLab is designed with three main capabilities in mind: (i) 3D exploration and visualization of fruit fly brain data, (ii) creation of executable circuits directly from the explored and visualized fly brain data, and (iii) interactive exploration of the functional logic of the devised executable circuits. FlyBrainLab provides an environment where computational researchers can present configurable, executable neural circuits, and experimental scientists can interactively explore circuit structure and function ultimately leading to biological validation.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:32:39Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-11T10:23:40Z","tool_type":["Workbench"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FlyBrainLab","home":"https://bio.tools/flybrainlab","license":"BSD-3-Clause","summary":"FlyBrainLab is an interactive computing platform for studying the function of executable circuits constructed from fruit fly brain data.
