{"tool_name":"viralverify","contents":["biotools"],"fetched_metadata":{"biotools":{"id":"viralverify","home":"https://github.com/ablab/viralVerify","summary":"viralVerify classifies contigs (output of metaviralSPAdes or other assemblers) as viral, non-viral or uncertain, based on gene content. Also for non-viral contigs it can optionally provide plasmid/non-plasmid classification.\n\nviralVerify predicts genes in the contig using Prodigal in the metagenomic mode, runs hmmsearch on the predicted proteins and classifies the contig as vrial or non-viral by applying the Naive Bayes classifier (NBC). For the set of predicted HMMs, viralVerify uses trained NBC to classify this set to be viral or chromosomal.","addition_date":"2022-09-19T17:45:48.981673Z","last_update_date":"2022-09-19T17:54:27.574471Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Script"],"version":["1.1"]}}}
