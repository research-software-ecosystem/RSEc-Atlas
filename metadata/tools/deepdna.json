DeepDNA, a novel unified model called deepDNA that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) with the long short-term memory network (LSTM) for compressing human mitochondrial genome sequences. The experiment has shown that out method deepDNA is able to learn sequence local features through a convolutional layer, and to learn higher level representations of long-term sequences dependencies through a long short-term memory network (LSTM) layer. We evaluated the learned genome sequences representations model on human mitochondrial genome sequences compressing tasks and achieved a satisfactory result.","addition_date":"2020-01-09T18:08:01Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-17T15:56:46Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"DeepDNA","home":"https://bio.tools/DeepDNA","license":"MIT","summary":"A hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network for compressing compression human mitochondrial genomes.
