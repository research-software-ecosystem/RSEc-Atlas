Isotopologue Parameter Optimization is a parameter optimization tool that is applicable for samples and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry devices, fast and free of labeling steps. It uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to calculate peak picking score. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiment. The resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:04:45Z","last_update_date":"2019-07-20T17:25:06Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.0.0"],"collections":["BioConductor","Proteomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"IPO","home":"https://bio.tools/ipo","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.0.0","summary":"The outcome of XCMS data processing strongly depends on the parameter settings.
