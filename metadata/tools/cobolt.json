It provides an integrated analysis of multi-omic data by learning a latent representation shared by the different data modalities. Cobolt jointly models these multiple modalities via a novel application of Multimodal Variational Autoencoder to a hierarchical generative model. It uses a probablity model that is robust to sparse counts and high numbers of features, therefore works for omics such as chromatin accessibility or methylation status.","addition_date":"2021-06-14T12:57:14Z","last_update_date":"2021-08-23T13:15:52Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Cobolt","home":"https://bio.tools/cobolt","license":"MIT","summary":"Cobolt is a method developed for modeling multi-omic single-cell sequencing datasets.
