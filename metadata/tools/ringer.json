The aim of Ringer is to go beyond static structural snapshots of proteins by uncovering structural ensembles in X-ray electron density. This information can reveal not only which parts of proteins are flexible and which part are rigid, but it also can define alternate conformations that may be important for function. Alternate conformations of binding sites also may afford additional targets for drug design.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:58:45Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:47:54.462140Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Ringer","home":"https://bio.tools/ringer","summary":"The program  detects molecular motions by automatic electron density sampling.
