We propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models, e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt, BigLittleNet, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models","addition_date":"2019-11-14T19:32:48Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-12T15:45:04Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"Res2Net","home":"https://bio.tools/Res2Net","summary":"A New Multi-scale Backbone Architecture | A New Multi-scale Backbone Architecture \u2013 \u7a0b\u660e\u660e\u6559\u6388\u4e3b\u9875 | Figure 1.
