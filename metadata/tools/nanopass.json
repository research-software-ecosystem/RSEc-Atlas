By simulating this process the experimentator can estimate the effective dose over time the cells are exposed to. Also, this gives an idea on at which time point the cells are exposed to the calculated concentration of sedimenting particles.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T10:58:56Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-08T09:23:03Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"NanoPASS","home":"https://bio.tools/nanopass","summary":"An easy-to-use user interface for nanoparticle dosimetry with the 3DSDD model.\n\nThe Nano Particle Administration Sedimentation Simulator (NanoPASS) is a package which intends to simulate the sedimentation process of nano particles in a cell culture well.
