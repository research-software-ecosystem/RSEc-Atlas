TopMatch-web provides an easy-to-use interface to a suite of techniques for protein structure alignments. Given a pair of protein structures, TopMatch calculates a list of alignments ordered by structural similarity. The corresponding superpositions can be explored in a 3D molecule viewer which highlights the structurally equivalent parts of the proteins.","addition_date":"2017-05-02T10:01:22Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:10:38.395623Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["Proteomics"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TopMatch","home":"https://bio.tools/topmatch","summary":"Computational tools for the alignment and superposition of protein structures are essential instruments in structural biology.
