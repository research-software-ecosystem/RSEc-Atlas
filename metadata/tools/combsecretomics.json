It offers the unique opportunity to study how multidrug treatments (i.e., more than 2 drugs) affect the protein release patterns of inactive/unprovoked and active/provoked cell populations. This molecular based evaluation approach of combination treatments opens for systematic studies associated with the secretome of complex diseases where there are still unmet diagnostic and therapeutic needs.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:06:26Z","last_update_date":"2021-02-17T13:17:58Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"COMBSecretomics","home":"https://bio.tools/combsecretomics","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"COMBSecretomics is a computational framework for secretome-related higher-order drug combination analysis.
