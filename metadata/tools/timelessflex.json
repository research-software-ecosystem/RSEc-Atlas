Inferring time series chromatin states for promoter-enhancer pairs based on Hi-C data.\nTimelessFlex is a flexible framework for investigating chromatin state trajectories during linear and branched tissue differentiation. This framework adapts and extends Timeless, a Bayesian network for co-clustering of multiple histone modifications at promoter and enhancer feature regions. TimelessFlex is flexible depending on the available genomic data. The basic required data is ChIP-seq for histone modifications with at least three time points and a set of regions of interest.","addition_date":"2021-03-19T08:39:23Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-23T15:52:52Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"TimelessFlex","home":"https://bio.tools/timelessflex","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"TimelessFlex - A flexible framework for investigating chromatin state trajectories.
