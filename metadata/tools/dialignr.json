This tool works with MS2 chromatograms directly and uses dynamic programming for alignment of raw chromatographic traces. DIAlignR uses a hybrid approach of global (feature-based) and local (raw data-based) alignment to establish correspondence between peaks.","edam_operations":[],"edam_topics":[],"toolshed_categories":["Proteomics"],"toolshed_id":"dialignr","users_5_years":2,"users_all_time":2,"usage_5_years":40,"usage_all_time":40,"related_tutorials":[],"related_workflows":[],"tool_ids":["dialignr"],"no_of_tools":{"eu":1,"org":0,"org.au":0,"be":0,"cz":1,"fr":0,"no":0}}}}
