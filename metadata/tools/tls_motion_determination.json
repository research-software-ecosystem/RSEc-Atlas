It does this by partitioning individual chains into multiple segments that are modeled as rigid bodies undergoing TLS (Translation/Libration/Screw) vibrational motion. It generates all possible partitions up to a maximum number of segments.","addition_date":"2017-12-06T18:14:58Z","last_update_date":"2019-09-04T08:38:59Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"collections":["Proteomics"]}}}
