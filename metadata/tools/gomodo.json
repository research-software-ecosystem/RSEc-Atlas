It uses HHsearch package 1.5.1 for performing sequence alignment. Only GPCR templates are chosen to build 3D model of given sequence by using Modeller 9.20. The obtained 3D model can be then docked with ligands uploaded by users with both Autodock VINA or HADDOCK. Binding pockets can be predicted by the FPOCKET, and structural alignment of models needed for VINA docking is performed by LOVOALIGN.
