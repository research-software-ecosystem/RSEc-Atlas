Kc-Align is a codon-aware multiple aligner that uses Kalgin2 to produce in-frame gapped codon alignments for selection analysis of small genomes (mostly viral and some smaller bacterial genomes). Takes nucleotide seqeunces as inputs, converts them to their in-frame amino acid sequences, performs multiple alignment with Kalign, and then converts the alignments back to their original codon sequence while preserving the gaps. Produces three outputs: the gapped nucleotide alignments in FASTA format and in CLUSTAL format and the amino acid level alignment.Kc-Align will also attempt to detect any frameshift mutations in the input reads. If a frameshift is detected, that sequence will not be included in the multiple alignment and its ID will be printed to stdout.","bio_tools_ids":"kc-align","bio_tools_name":"kc-align","related_tutorials":[],"related_workflows":[{"create_time":"2020-03-31","latest_version":30,"link":"https://usegalaxy.org/published/workflow?id=a46ad0b9240d1a13","name":"Viral Evolution Analysis (NCBI Data)"},{"create_time":"2020-05-04","latest_version":3,"link":"https://usegalaxy.org/published/workflow?id=e1cc0886cd27b92e","name":"Evolution Analysis (All Other Data)"}],"tool_ids":["kc-align"],"no_of_tools":{"eu":1,"org":1,"org.au":0,"be":1,"cz":1,"fr":0,"no":1}}}}
