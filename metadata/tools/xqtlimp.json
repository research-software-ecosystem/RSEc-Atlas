Specifically, it models the statistics of variants associated with the same molecular trait by using a multivariate Gaussian model, and infers missing association statistics from nearby known association statistics by leveraging LD among variants (See Methods in the paper). Using multiple real datasets, we demonstrated that 1) xQTLImp can impute missing xQTL statistics with high accuracy, and 2) xQTLImp can effiectively reduce the lower bound of MAF in xQTL studies, leading to the discovery of novel xQTL signals to further enhance xQTL discoveries.","addition_date":"2019-11-14T18:15:57Z","last_update_date":"2022-01-20T22:21:00.441232Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"xQTLImp","home":"https://bio.tools/xQTLImp","license":"Not licensed","summary":"xQTLImp is an open source software that implements imputation of xQTL(such as eQTL, mQTL, haQTL et. al) statistics across the genome. xQTLImp accepts xQTL summary statistics (i.e., Z statistics) without the need of individual-level genotypes and molecular traits (such as gene expression profiles), and could accurately impute novel xQTL associations from known associations based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) among variants.
