MB-GAN can automatically learn from a given microbial abundances and compute simulated abundances that are indistinguishable from it. In practice, MB-GAN showed the following advantages. First, MB-GAN avoids explicit statistical modeling assumptions, and it only requires real datasets as inputs. Second, unlike the traditional GANs, MB-GAN is easily applicable and can converge efficiently.
