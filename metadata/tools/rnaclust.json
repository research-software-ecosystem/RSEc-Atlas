In the first step for each input sequence the base pair probability matrix of its secondary structure distribution is calculated. Secondly, for each pair of base pair probability matrices a sequence-structure alignment is calculated. Lastly, a hierarchical cluster-tree is derived by WPGMA clustering of the pairwise alignment distances and the optimal number of clusters is calculated from the tree.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:11:51Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.3"]}}}
