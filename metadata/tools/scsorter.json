Based on an observation that the expected over-expression of marker genes is often absent in a nonnegligible proportion of cells, we develop a method called scSorter. scSorter allows marker genes to express at a low level and borrows information from the expression of non-marker genes. On both simulated and real data, scSorter shows much higher power compared to existing methods","addition_date":"2021-03-19T09:11:28Z","last_update_date":"2021-04-08T11:16:51Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"scSorter","home":"https://bio.tools/scsorter","summary":"scSorter is a tool for assigning cells to known cell types according to marker genes.\n\nOn single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we consider the problem of assigning cells to known cell types, assuming that the identities of cell-type-specific marker genes are given but their exact expression levels are unavailable, that is, without using a reference dataset.
