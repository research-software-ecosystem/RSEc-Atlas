It seeks the linear order of loci that minimizes the sum of adjacent recombination fractions or that maximizes the log likelihood of locus order. Analyses based on simulated data sets indicated that the algorithm displayed a high efficiency level. The high performance of the algorithm enabled to save time and labor, and also to validate an estimated order by bootstrap tests.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:03:36Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["1.2"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"AntMap","home":"https://bio.tools/antmap","version":"1.2","summary":"It is a software for constructing genetic linkage maps using an ant colony optimization algorithm.
