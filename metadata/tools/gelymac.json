It runs on a Macintosh computer only. The first step in using the this program is to enter data for a known marker. Both the distances traveled and the fragment sizes are entered. Then the distances migrated by up to 19 sets of DNA fragments are entered, and the program calculates the sizes of these fragments using a cubic-spline interpolation.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:07:07Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:59Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
