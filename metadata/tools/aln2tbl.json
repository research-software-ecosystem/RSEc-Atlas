The sequencing, annotation and analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes is an important research tool in phylogeny and evolution. Starting with the primary sequence, genes features are generally annotated automatically to obtain preliminary annotations in the form of a feature table. Further manual curation in a graphic alignment editor is nevertheless necessary to revise annotations. As such, the automatically generated feature table is invalidated and has to be modified manually before submission to data banks.","addition_date":"2022-03-14T07:30:16.901130Z","last_update_date":"2022-03-14T07:30:16.904489Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Aln2tbl","home":"https://bio.tools/aln2tbl","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Aln2tbl is a Python script for building a mitochondrial features table from a assembly alignment in fasta format.
