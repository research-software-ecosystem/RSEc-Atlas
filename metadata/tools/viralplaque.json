Indeed, plaque morphology and dimensions can provide information regarding the replication kinetics and the virulence of a particular virus. In this work, we present ViralPlaque, a fast, open-source and versatile ImageJ macro for the automated determination of viral plaque dimensions from digital images. Also, a machine learning plugin is integrated in the analysis algorithm for adaptation of ViralPlaque to the user's needs and experimental conditions. A high correlation between manual and automated measurements of plaque dimensions was demonstrated. This macro will facilitate reliable and reproducible characterization of cytolytic viruses with an increased processing speed","addition_date":"2020-01-09T17:47:44Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-02T15:49:24Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"ViralPlaque","home":"https://bio.tools/ViralPlaque","summary":"a Fiji macro for automated assessment of viral plaque statistics.\n\nPlaque assay has been used for a long time to determine infectious titers and characterize prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses forming plaques.
