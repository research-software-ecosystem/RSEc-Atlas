Based on an auto-encoder with a carefully tailored loss function, stPlus performs joint embedding and predicts spatial gene expression via a weighted k-NN. The spatial transcriptomics enhanced by stPlus can provide better characterization of cell heterogeneity.","addition_date":"2021-12-06T13:26:51.075210Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:14:54.189194Z","tool_type":["Library"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"stPlus","home":"https://bio.tools/stplus","license":"MIT","summary":"stPlus is a reference-based method for the accurate enhancement of spatial transcriptomics. stPlus is a reference-based method for the accurate enhancement of spatial transcriptomics.
