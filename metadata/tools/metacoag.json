MetaCoAG makes use of single-copy marker genes along with a graph matching technique and a label propagation technique to bin contigs. MetaCoAG is tested on contigs obtained from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Currently MetaCoAG supports contigs assembled using metaSPAdes and MEGAHIT.","addition_date":"2022-02-17T12:11:43.840915Z","last_update_date":"2022-02-17T12:11:43.843320Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MetaCoAG","home":"https://bio.tools/metacoag","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"MetaCoAG is a metagenomic contig binning tool that makes use of the connectivity information found in assembly graphs, apart from the composition and coverage information.
