Although TOA was primarily designed to work with woody plant species, it can also be used in the analysis of experiments on any type of plant organism. Additionally, NCBI Gene, InterPro and Gene Ontology databases are also used to complete the information.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T11:19:12Z","last_update_date":"2021-03-01T09:09:01Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"TOA","home":"https://bio.tools/toa","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"A software package for automated functional annotation in non-model plant species.\n\nTOA (Taxonomy-oriented Annotation).\n\nTOA aims to establish workflows geared towards plant species that automate the extraction of information from genomic databases and the annotation of sequences.
