Firstly a set of bicluster classifiers is build using a labelled training set from the annotated ORFs in the expression data. These biclusters are then used to classify an unlabelled ORF set i.e. the unannotated ORFs from the expression dataset.","addition_date":"2017-08-03T18:36:43Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]}}}
