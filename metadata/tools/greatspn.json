Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) is one of the most common form of MS in adults and is characterized by a series of neurologic symptoms, followed by periods of remission. Recently, many treatments were proposed and studied to contrast the RRMS progression. Among these drugs, daclizumab (commercial name Zinbryta), an antibody tailored against the Interleukin-2 receptor of T cells, exhibited promising results, but its efficacy was accompanied by an increased frequency of serious adverse events.","addition_date":"2020-01-14T20:06:18Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-07T08:11:56Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GreatSPN","home":"https://bio.tools/GreatSPN","summary":"A computational approach based on the colored Petri net formalism for studying multiple sclerosis.\n\nBACKGROUND:Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) which damages the myelin sheath enveloping nerve cells thus causing severe physical disability in patients.
