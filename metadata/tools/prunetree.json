You can make subtrees by either including (or excluding) a specific group of taxa. In addition, it also has options to arbitrarily transform internode branch lengths (BL) following a speciational model (all BL = 1) or following Pagel?s method (all taxa aligned and all internode BL = 1).","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:10:33Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:58Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["5.0"]}}}
