The algorithm utilizes the deep sequencing reads generated by PAR-CLIP (Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation) protocol.The use of photoactivatable nucleotides in the PAR-CLIP protocol results in more efficient crosslinking between the RNA-binding protein and its target relative to other CLIP methods; in addition a nucleotide substitution occurs at the site of crosslinking, providing for single-nucleotide resolution binding information. PARalyzer utilizes this nucleotide substition in a kernel density estimate classifier to generate the high resolution set of Protein-RNA interaction sites.","identifiers":["biotools:paralyzer"]},"biocontainers":{"name":"paralyzer","identifiers":["biotools:paralyzer","doi:10.1186/gb-2011-12-8-r79"],"license":"PARalyzer is provided for academic use only, if you wish to use it in another setting please contact Uwe Ohler.","summary":"Tool to analyze cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data (clip)"},"biotools":{"id":"paralyzer","home":"https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/PARalyzer_85/","summary":"Tool to analyze cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data (CLIP)","addition_date":"2017-01-13T13:15:46Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T15:32:37.399252Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"PARalyzer","home":"https://bio.tools/paralyzer","summary":"Tool to analyze cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data (CLIP)","tool_type":"sc:SoftwareApplication"}}}
