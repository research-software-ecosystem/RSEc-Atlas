Additionally to information from experimentally resolved protein structures, d-StructMAn can also harness all protein structure models stored in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.","addition_date":"2022-07-04T11:19:16.563678Z","last_update_date":"2022-12-01T17:43:58.036748Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"d-StructMAn","home":"https://bio.tools/d-structman","summary":"d-StructMAn is a new improved implementation of our earlier tool StructMAn, shipped in a convenient and easily installable container form and extended to annotation of short in-frame indels and alterations arising as a consequence of alternative splicing events. d-StructMAn produces a wide range of structural features by combining information from experimentally resolved structures of many related proteins, which is a unique feature of the StructMAn family tools.
