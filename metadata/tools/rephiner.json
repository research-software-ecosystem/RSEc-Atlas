Rephine.r is a command-line R script designed to identify common errors in gene clustering that can arise when building phage pangenomes.

Correcting these errors will often make it possible to identify new single-copy core genes that can be used downstream to build phylogenies.","addition_date":"2021-11-29T10:16:11.387518Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:15:38.928955Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Workflow"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Rephine.r","home":"https://bio.tools/rephiner","license":"GPL-3.0","summary":"Rephine.r is a pipeline for correcting gene calls and clusters to improve phage pangenomes and phylogenies.
