'DrugSim2DR' first predict drug-drug functional similarity in the context of specific disease, and then using the similarity constructed a weighted drug similarity network. Finally, it used a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify drugs with significant target abnormalities as candidate drugs.","addition_date":"2023-10-13T09:57:26.968130Z","last_update_date":"2023-10-13T09:57:26.970631Z","version":["0.1.1"]}}}
