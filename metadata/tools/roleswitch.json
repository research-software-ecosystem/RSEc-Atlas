It operates in two phases by inferring the probability of mRNA being the targets of miRNA, considering the expression of all the mRNAs due to their potential competition for the same miRNA. It assumes that the total transcribed mRNA levels are higher than the observed mRNA levels and iteratively updates the total transcription of each mRNA targets based on the above inference.","addition_date":"2017-01-17T15:05:35Z","last_update_date":"2019-01-10T05:08:56Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library"],"version":["1.12.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Roleswitch","home":"https://bio.tools/roleswitch","license":"GPL-2.0","version":"1.12.0","summary":"Infer Probabilities of MiRNA-mRNA Interaction Signature (ProMISe) using paired expression data from a single sample.
