From the data, it will fit one component for each of the following copy number states: deletion, copy-neutral, 1 and 2 additional copy; with a constraint on the difference between the mixture means. Then for a given individual, it will determine the probabilities for each copy number state and compute the expected copy number (dosage).","addition_date":"2017-12-06T18:14:31Z","last_update_date":"2019-09-04T08:37:48Z","tool_type":["Web application"]}}}
