Nucleic acids with alternative backbones or nucleobases can be constructed by the program by supplying the 3D structure of isolated backbones or nucleobases. The program can perform a helical parameter search and backbone conformation search and find reasonable nucleic acid structures. Geometric and energetic criteria are used to evaluate candidate structures. The program is written in C++ and Python, and has a graphical user interface. The program is available for the Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T12:24:26Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:46:41.272353Z"},"bioschemas":{"name":"proto-Nucleic Acid Builder","home":"https://bio.tools/pnab","license":"GPL-2.0","summary":"proto-Nucleic Acid Builder (pNAB) \nThe proto-Nucleic Acid Builder is a program for modeling the 3D strucutres of DNA, RNA, and nucleic acid analogs.
