Momba strives to deliver an integrated and intuitive experience to aid the process of model construction, validation, and analysis. It provides convenience functions for the modular construction of models effectively turning Python into a syntax-aware macro language for quantitative models. Momba's built-in exploration engine allows gaining confidence in a model, for instance, by rapidly prototyping a tool for interactive model exploration and visualization, or by connecting it to a testing framework. Finally, thanks to the JANI-model interchange format, several state-of-the-art model checkers and other tools are readily available for model analysis.","addition_date":"2021-10-11T07:08:01.768086Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:17:59.822857Z","tool_type":["Suite"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"Momba","home":"https://bio.tools/momba","license":"MIT","summary":"Momba is a Python framework for dealing with quantitative models centered around the JANI-model interchange format.
