With BAR 3.0 and a sequence you can annotate when possible: function, structure, protein domains. Also if your sequence falls into a cluster with a structural/some structural template/s we provide an alignment towards the template/templates based on the Cluster-HMM that allows you to directly compute your 3D model. Cluster HMMs are available for downloading.","addition_date":"2015-01-22T11:31:43Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:11:34.270190Z","tool_type":["Web application"],"version":["3.0"],"collections":["Bologna Biocomputing Group"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"BAR","home":"https://bio.tools/bar","version":"3.0","summary":"It is for the annotation of protein sequences relying on a comparative large-scale analysis on the entire UniProt.
