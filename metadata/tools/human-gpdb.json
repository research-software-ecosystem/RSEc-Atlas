The database currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-Proteins and 99 human Effectors. The collection of the information about the interactions between these molecules was done manually and the current status of Human-gpDB reveals information about 1663 connections between GPCRs and G-Proteins and 1618 connections between G-Proteins and Effectors. The sequences of G-Proteins and GPCRs are classified according to a hierarchy of different classes, families and sub-families, whereas the Effectors sequences are classified in families, subfamilies and types, based on extensive literature search. The classification of GPCRs follows the IUPHAR classification, while the Effectors classification is a unique feature and is based on their function.","addition_date":"2023-09-07T12:57:16.987265Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T14:15:33.906543Z","tool_type":["Bioinformatics portal","Database portal","Web application"],"collections":["gpcr"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"human-gpDB","home":"https://bio.tools/human-gpdb","summary":"Human-gpDB is a publicly accessible, relational database of human G-Proteins and their interactions with human GPCRs and Effectors.
