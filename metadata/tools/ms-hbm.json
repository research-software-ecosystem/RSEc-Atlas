A multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating high-quality individual-specific network-level parcellations. Here, we extend the model to estimate individual-specific areal-level parcellations. While network-level parcellations comprise spatially distributed networks spanning the cortex, the consensus is that areal-level parcels should be spatially localized, i.e., should not span multiple lobes. There is disagreement about whether areal-level parcels should be strictly contiguous or comprise multiple non-contiguous components, therefore we considered three areal-level MS-HBM variants spanning these range of possibilities: distributed MS-HBM (dMSHBM), contiguous MS-HBM (cMSHBM) and gradient-infused MS-HBM (gMSHBM).","addition_date":"2021-10-11T08:34:24.837556Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-24T20:17:55.806073Z","tool_type":["Script"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"MS-HBM","home":"https://bio.tools/ms-hbm","summary":"MS-HBM is script for individual-specific areal-level parcellations improve functional connectivity prediction of behavior.
