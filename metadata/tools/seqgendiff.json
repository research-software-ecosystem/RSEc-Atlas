The advantage of using this approach over simulating under a theoretical distribution is that common/annoying aspects of the data are more preserved, giving a more realistic evaluation of your method. The main functions are select_counts(), thin_diff(), thin_lib(), thin_gene(), thin_2group(), thin_all(), and effective_cor().
