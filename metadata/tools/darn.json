It finds all the subsequences that match a specified motif on some input genomic sequence(s).Darn uses a weighted constraint solver to localize the portions of a genomic sequence that match a motif. The motif is expressed in a specific language (see section 5). Some motif descriptors are provided with the software for FMN, Lysine, RNaseP, SAM,snoRNA C/D-box and tRNA search.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:05:45Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:58:57Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"],"version":["1.0"]}}}
