Three types of plots are available: 1) shark plots (basic trees, showing the phylogeny and optionally the cancer cell fraction CCF); 2) dolphin plots (advanced visualization, showing the phylogeny and the development of CCFs over time); 3) plaice plots (novel visualization, showing the phylogeny, the development of CCFs and the development of remaining healthy alleles, influenced by bi-allelic events, over time). Moreover, the tool provides algorithms for fully automatic interpolation of time points and estimation of therapy effect to approximate a tumor's development in the presence of few measured time points, as well as exploring alternative trees.","addition_date":"2023-01-18T09:58:02.321637Z","last_update_date":"2023-01-18T10:20:59.143492Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool","Library","Workflow"],"version":["0.99.5"],"collections":["Bioconductor"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"clevRvis","home":"https://bio.tools/clevrvis","license":"LGPL-3.0","version":"0.99.5","summary":"clevRvis provides an extensive set of visualization techniques for clonal evolution.
