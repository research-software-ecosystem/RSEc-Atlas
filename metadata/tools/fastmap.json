It exploits the discrete nature and structure of the measured single nucleotide polymorphisms. SNPs are organized into a Hamming distance-based tree. Its tree can be used to perform both single marker mapping and haplotype association mapping over an m-SNP window. These performance enhancements also permit permutation-based significance testing.","addition_date":"2017-12-18T00:06:28Z","last_update_date":"2024-11-25T14:37:29.335427Z","tool_type":["Desktop application"],"version":["2.0"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"FastMap","home":"https://bio.tools/fastmap","version":"2.0","summary":"It is used for fast and efficient eQTL mapping in homozygous inbred populations with binary allele calls.
