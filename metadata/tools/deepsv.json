The visualization is designed to capture multiple sources of information in the data that are relevant to long deletions. DeepSV also implements techniques for working with noisy training data. DeepSV trains a model from the visualized sequence reads and calls deletions based on this model. We demonstrate that DeepSV outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency of deletion calling on the data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Our work shows that deep learning can potentially lead to effective calling of different types of genetic variations that are complex than SNPs","addition_date":"2020-01-14T19:35:29Z","last_update_date":"2020-12-20T11:59:31Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"DeepSV","home":"https://bio.tools/DeepSV","summary":"A accurate calling of genomic deletions from high-throughput sequencing data using deep convolutional neural network.\n\nCalling deletions using deep convolutional neural.\n\nDeepSV, an approach based on deep learning for calling long deletions from sequence reads.DeepSV is based on a novel method of visualizing sequence reads.
