In addition to simple counts, it can derive average nearest neighbors for each cell-type and interaction summary profiles for each celltype. These statistics are derived across images, both overall and regions of interest as defined by user defined masks.","addition_date":"2018-07-11T11:42:32Z","last_update_date":"2018-12-10T12:59:00Z","tool_type":["Library"],"version":["1.3.0"],"collections":["BioConductor"]}}}
