It accurately and efficiently reduces the number of possible compound heterozygous variant pairs being examined around either predefined genetic loci or from a list of preselected variant pairs. To achieve this, SmartPhase is able to incorporate parental genotype information as well as reads generated from DNA- or RNA-sequencing. Furthermore, it incorporates existing haplotype information and applies logical rules to exclude variant constellations that cannot be disease causing.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T07:28:13Z","last_update_date":"2021-05-20T06:16:14Z","collections":["Rare Disease"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"SmartPhase","home":"https://bio.tools/smartphase","summary":"Accurate and fast phasing of heterozygous variant pairs for genetic diagnosis of rare diseases.\n\nSmartPhase is a phasing tool tailored for clinical use in genetic diagnosis pipelines.
