GeFaST (Generalised Fastidious Swarming Tool) picks up the two-phased, iterative clustering strategy of Swarm and generalises resp. extends both the clustering and the refinement phase. GeFaST considers the iterative strategy as an abstract scheme, which can be coupled with different notions of distance. The refinement phase has been generalised by broadening the applicability of the original fastidious approach and introducing further refinement methods."}}}
