It returns counts of reads exactly matching each allele of each SNP in a concise table-shaped format for its output, with one row for each bi-allelic SNP site that has exactly 8 fields: species, SNP ID, contig, contig position, allele 1, allele 2 and coverage of allele 1 and coverage of allele 2. The k-mer exact match based genotyping algorithm is optimized for machine specificiations, and it can run on a personal computer.","addition_date":"2021-01-18T09:45:34Z","last_update_date":"2021-01-25T11:49:06Z","tool_type":["Command-line tool"]},"bioschemas":{"name":"GT-Pro","home":"https://bio.tools/gt-pro","license":"MIT","summary":"Ultra-rapid metagenotyping of the human gut microbiome.\n\nGT-Pro - the GenoTyper for PROkaryotes.\n\nUltra-rapid genotyping of prokaryotes in shotgun metagenomes.\n\nTo genotype a microbiome, GT-Pro takes as input one or more shotgun metagenomics sequencing libraries in FASTQ format.
