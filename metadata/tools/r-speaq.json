'speaq' offers the possibility of raw spectra alignment and quantitation but also an analysis based on features whereby the spectra are converted to peaks which are then grouped and turned into features. These features can be processed with any number of statistical tools either included in 'speaq' or available elsewhere on CRAN."}}}
